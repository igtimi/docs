# Using TalkBot

This article assumes that you have previously configured your TalkBot. If this is not the case, see [Configuration of TalkBot](../../Custom%20Projects/YNZ%20Comms%20Systems/Configuration%20of%20TalkBot.md) before continuing.

**Turning on TalkBot**

Press and hold the power button until you hear two beeps and the power indicator goes solid.

During the power up sequence, the remaining 4 indicators will illuminate dimly to indicate the system is active and powering up. 

The boot time takes between 45 seconds, to 1 minute to complete.

Once the power up sequence is complete, the 4 indicators will do a full brightness 'ramp' sequence, followed by turning off completely. 

**Connecting to devices to TalkBot**

With TalkBot powered up and running, you can now connect your Bluetooth devices.

  

**Bluetooth headset**

If this is the first time using the headset with TalkBot, you need to pair the headset with TalkBot before you can use the headset.

Pairing only needs to be done on the first time connecting to TalkBot, if your headset has been used with the TalkBot already, skip to 'Connecting your headset'.

  

_Pairing headset_

To pair the headset with TalkBot, power on and put the headset into pairing mode. Instructions for how to do this can be found in the documentation from your headset manufacturer. 

Pairing should complete in short manner, and a "Mic" light should illuminate to indicate the device is successfully connected.

  

_Connecting headset_

If you have just paired your headset to TalkBot, then it should already be connected and you can skip the below connection process.

For all other headsets (those that have previously been paired to TalkBot), simply power on the device and wait for the "Mic" light to illuminate solid.

If you don't see a "Mic" light successfully illuminate, try to re-pair the headset to TalkBot. If there is still no connection, check the configuration settings are correct. 

  

**Remote TalkBot**

The connection between two TalkBots should be automatic when both units are powered up and running. You should see the light beside "Link" illuminate on both units, indicating an active long range link.

If this is not successful, then their is either a configuration error, or the Coach unit is set up to have an "On demand" connection, and the Coach headset is not connected. This is explained in more detail in the [Configuration of TalkBot](../../Custom%20Projects/YNZ%20Comms%20Systems/Configuration%20of%20TalkBot.md) article here.

  

**YachtBot**

To successfully connect a YachtBot device to TalkBot, you first need to configure the YachtBot device before continuing. See [Configuration of YachtBot for Athlete audio recording](../../Custom%20Projects/YNZ%20Comms%20Systems/Configuration%20of%20YachtBot%20for%20recording.md). 

Pairing needs only be done once. If your YachtBot has been paired with TalkBot already, skip to 'Connecting YachtBot'.

  

_Pairing YachtBot_

To pair YachtBot with TalkBot, power on the YachtBot device. 

Once YachtBot has powered up, press the power button 5 times. This will put the YachtBot in pairing mode, and the Bluetooth indicator should be blip quickly.

Once the pairing is complete, the Bluetooth indicator on the YachtBot should return to flashing slowly. This indicates that the pairing is complete.

See below for clarification on expected indicator behavior on both YachtBot and TalkBot devices. 

  

_Connecting YachtBot_

If your YachtBot has already been paired to TalkBot, simply power on your YachtBot and connection to TalkBot should be automatic.

See below for expected indicator behavior on both TalkBot and YachtBot devices.

  

_Expected indicator_ _behavior_

TalkBot "Recording" indicator will remain off until an active connection is made to YachtBot for recording. YachtBot will flash the Bluetooth indicator slowly until TalkBot makes an active recording connection. 

The recording connection will only occur when _one or more_ Athlete headsets are connected to TalkBot and at least one headset is active. 

When an Athlete headset is active and connected to TalkBot, the Bluetooth indicator on the YachtBot should be solid to indicate an active recording. The "Recording" indicator on TalkBot should also be illuminated. YachtBot is now recording the Athlete audio from TalkBot.

This behavior prevents YachtBot from recording long periods of silence when the Athlete headset is not active.

  

**Turning off TalkBot**

To power off TalkBot, press and hold the power button until you hear a single beep. TalkBot will begin its shutdown sequence, with the power indicator flashing slowly.

Once the shutdown sequence is complete, the power indicator will turn off.
