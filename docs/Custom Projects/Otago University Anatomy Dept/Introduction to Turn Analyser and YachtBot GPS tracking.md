# Introduction to Turn Analyser and YachtBot GPS tracking

This help section has specific information on a bespoke project developed for the Anatomy Dept, which automatically counts the number and type of turns a sheep makes during a period of time.

  

Sheep are tracked by mounting YachtBot trackers to purpose built harnesses.  The YachtBot devices should be pointing to the back of the sheep so the devices get the best possible GPS signal.  The YachtBot devices required for the Turn Analyser software, have an IMU (Inertial measurement unit) upgrade and connect to a GPS base station for improved GPS accuracy.

  

General information on how to operate a YachtBot device can be found [here](http://support.yacht-bot.com/solution/categories/8000022006). 

  

Specific information on configuring the YachtBot IMU can be found [here](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals/Using%20the%20IMU/AHRS%20with%20YachtBot.md).

  

Specific information on setting up the YachtBot Base station can be found [here](http://support.yacht-bot.com/solution/folders/8000082188).

  

Other articles in this section will detail how to install the Turn Analyser software, and will have project specific help information.
