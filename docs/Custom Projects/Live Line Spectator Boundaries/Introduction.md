# Introduction

This support content is aimed at operators of the YachtBot Spectator Boundary system.

  

The hardware you are using are standard YachtBot units. General information about them, including details on charging, opening the bung, and troubleshooting can be found [here](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals).

  

The software you are using on your tablet is the YachtBot Web App, accessed through the Chrome browser. Since the races on YachtBot aren't available publicly, you need to login to YachtBot with the AmCup credentials. When viewing the race, you are doing so as the race owner. General information about using the viewer can be found [here](../../YachtBot%20Web/Race%20Viewer/Tips%20&%20Tricks.md).
