# YachtBot: hardware basics

There is a lot of material on YachtBot hardware within these articles. Here are some of the important ones that will help you keep the gear in good working order.

  

Do's and Don'ts
---------------

  

Always use YachtBot with the supplied bung or risk damaging the unit beyond repair. When the bung is fitted, the unit is fully water-proof. Without it, the electronics are exposed and small amounts of salt water can cause extensive corrosion. Bungs should be greased regularly and are easiest removed using the attached stainless clip. If requiring a lot of force, grease the corners more thoroughly. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftc8TsLwa2g) shows how to remove the bung, which you will need to do for charging the units.

  

Always test your cell connection early. On the water, on the first day of racing is too late. To do a end-to-end test, simply turn on the YachtBot devices outside (with a full view of the sky to obtain a GPS lock) and log in to www.yacht-bot.com. When all three lights on the units are on solid, the device appears as LIVE on the Dashboard.

  

Always charge using the supplied DC charger. Charging via USB is not intended. YachtBot's battery will run, depending on cell phone coverage, for 10-14 hours. Re-charging overnight between event days is required: power the unit off, then plug it into charge. The power light turns on solid while charging, then turns off when charging is finished.

### APN Settings: making YachtBot work with different SIM cards

On your travels, you'll likely use different SIM cards from different providers. Like most smart phones, YachtBot requires the APN settings to explicitly set to connect to the network. Learn how to make changes to the [configuration file](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals/Configuration%20File.md) and [APN settings](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals/SIM%20data%20settings.md). How do you know if the cell connection works? The indicator light on YachtBot turns solid when connected and the device's location can be seen in the YachtBot Dashboard.
