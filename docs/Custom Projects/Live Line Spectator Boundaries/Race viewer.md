### Do's and Don'ts

  

The boundary setting race is not available publicly. This means that in order to do the buoy placement, you need to login to YachtBot. Each operator logs in with the same credentials and views the race as the race owner. This allows you, in theory, to make changes to the session that everyone is working from.

  

Never delete any races or unregister any devices unless you know exactly what you are doing, or have been explicitly instructed to do so.

  

Background

The races are automatically generated by server magic. As the operator placing buoys, all you need to do is select the correct, usually LIVE, race from the list of available races. Each race has a unique number, shown in the address bar of the Chrome browser. If in doubt, check the race number with your supervisor.
