# Troubleshoot: Some or none of the blue LEDs are on

This may or may not be an issue. There should be one blue light per connected device (headset, YachtBot or other boat), which means that it is possible that all lights may not be lit. If appropriate lights are not lit follow the following steps:

  

*   Is the device (headset/YachtBot/boat) connected? 
*   Is this the correct device to be connected, if not, swap to proper device. 
*   Try turning the device off and on again.    
    
*   Has this device been used with this box before? Put the device in pairing mode to see if it will connect.   
    
*   Try a spare headset   
    

  

If no connection after 2-3 mins try restarting the box.
