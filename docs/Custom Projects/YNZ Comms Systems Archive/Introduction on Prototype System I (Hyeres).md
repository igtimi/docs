# Introduction on Prototype System I (Hyeres)

A parcel with the hardware was posted on Friday, April 8.

  

  

What's in the parcel
--------------------

There are 3 boxes (Box 1 = **A**thlete, Box 2 = **C**oach, Box 3 = Spare).

There are 2 coach headsets (Stealths C1 and C2) paired to work with the Coach box.

Both Jabras, Stealths A1 and A2 are paired with the Athlete box. Any combinations of these should cover your main use.

  

These will just need to be turned on for them to work ... note that only 2 headsets can connect to a box at any one time.  

  

Batteries are charged to various levels. They were all fully charged in the office on Thursday, but were all tested to ensure everything was working on Friday prior to departure so some may need charging.  Instructions for general use are in the following help articles.  

  

Spares
------

The spare box is set up to replace either the athlete or the coach by using [the switch](../../Custom%20Projects/YNZ%20Comms%20Systems%20Archive/First%20steps.md).

  

No headsets are paired with the spare box at the moment.

Stealths A3 and A4 are both set up to replace any of the athlete headsets, i.e. their hardware IDs are loaded onto the Athletes Box, but they are not paired.

  

The reason for not pairing them yet is that they can only be **paired once** without us connecting them to a computer. With them not being paired they can be used with a YachtBot until they are required for use with the Comms System. If they are used with Bluemix then YachtBot (or the spare Bluemix box) there is no guarantee that the Stealth will remember the original pairing key so it is best at this moment to not use the spare box or headsets unless required.

  

### Using the Spare box

Should the spare box be required the headsets need to be put into pairing mode (hold the on button on the headset until the light flashes blue/red) for them to pair and connect. In athlete mode, headsets A1, A2, A3, A4 and both Jabras are loaded, and in coach mode, C1 and C2 are loaded.
