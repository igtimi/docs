# Accessing log files

If the log files are required Bluemix Box should be plugged into a computer. To do this carefully lift up the foam underneath the battery at the connection end. Underneath is the BeagleBone which can carefully be lifted at this end to show a mini USB port. Plugging this into a computer will mount a drive called "Igtimi Bluemix \[Box Number\]" (or sometimes just IGTIMI). On there should be a .tar file containing all of the logs contained on that unit (.BluemixLog format).

  

BUYER BEWARE: The config files are also on this drive and should not be modified unless explicitly instructed by Igtimi to do so. Editing these files incorrectly has the potential to render the system useless and require shipping back to us.
