# YNZ Display Boz (B&G)

The YNZ Display Box features a power button, a rocker switch and two connector sockets (for connecting to boat power and WindBot pole). The sockets can perform either function.

  

On sequence
-----------

Always turn on WindBot before the Display Box, to avoid WindBot going into charging mode unintentionally. Press and hold down the button for 3s to turn on the WindBot as described in the [Turning YachtBot on/off](../../YachtBot%20Products/Deprecated%20articles/Turning%20YachtBot%20on/off.md) article.  

  

Now turn on the Display. The red light on the Display Box turns on solid, indicating that both data communication and charging have been established.

  

If the device has started in charge mode, the top indicator on the WindBot is solid, but the two indicators below remain off. The light in the Display Box rocker switch blinks. Simply press the orange power button again until the two lower indicator lights start blinking.

  

Off sequence
------------

To turn the system off, first turn off the Display Box to terminate power to the WindBot. Then turn WindBot off, by pressing and holding down the button for 3s until you hear one long beep.

  

Powering
--------

The YNZ WindBot is intended to be permanently charged by boat power, allowing the internal battery to be nearly always fully charged. If your RIB doesn’t provide access to the battery, you can run it from a separate 12V battery.  

  

Water current (WCT) measurements
--------------------------------

The water current measurement can be initiated with the rocker switch on the Display Box.
