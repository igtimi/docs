# SIM cards

YNZ units are typically used without a SIM card, because the Display Box is a standard part of the system and YNZ typically uses the system in environments controlled by ISAF rules.

  

However, using a SIM card for live recording can be a useful debugging tool as it allows Igtimi staff to view live or logged data remotely.  

Alternatively, use the system without a SIM card but enable logging, then insert a SIM card and take advantage of sync to upload the data.
