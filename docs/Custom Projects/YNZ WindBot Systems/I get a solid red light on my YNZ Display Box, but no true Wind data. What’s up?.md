# I get a solid red light on my YNZ Display Box, but no true Wind data. What’s up?

Not all details outlined here apply to the YNZ system https://yachtbot.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/8000014247-i-cannot-see-true-wind-on-my-b-g-display-help-

  

YNZ Displays do not receive longitude and latitude, so you rely on the WindBot's indicator light for checking that you have a GPS fix.

  

It appears you have a faulty connection somewhere. This is in the rarest cases due to the cable having an electrical short, and more often caused by a poorly connected cable.

Visually expect all cables for breakages or sharp bends, unplug all connections and inspect pins for excessive corrosion. If you see dirt or corrosion, clean debris out carefully. If available, grease all plugs and plug the connectors in and out a few times to polish the pins.

  

If unsuccessful, change the cable and try again.
