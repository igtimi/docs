# Modified hardware

Specific to YNZ units, WindBot is modified in the following manner:

  

The pole is cut into two pieces. The top and bottom parts of the poles are joined with a straight cut and feature a push to release mechanism rather than Velcro strapping .  
  
The WindBot brain is more permanently attached to the top part of the pole by means of four screws. In normal operation, you should not need to remove the WindBot brain from the pole.  
   
If securely moored, the WindBot does not require disassembly in day to day operations   
  
All YNZ WindBots feature a pigtail cable, via which the WindBot is connected to the Display Box. The Display Box connection facilitates charging from the boat battery and data transfer to the display.   

  

All YNZ WindBots are shipped with

  

*   A YNZ Display box  
    
*   A minimum of one black cable for connection between WindBot and the Display  
    
*   A battery cable in two parts; lugs to green automotive connector to standard black connector
