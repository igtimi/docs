# Introduction to Canoeing Splits System

The Canoeing Splits System is a GPS-based tool that provides accurately measurement elapsed time and distances over typical kayak and canoeing race course distances. The system allows athletes, coaches and performance analysts to view the output data in real-time via the Canoeing Splits App. The Igtimi servers make the data available for detailed post analysis.
