# Rovers indicators

The YachtBot rover is mounted on the canoe, either on or under the aft deck behind the athlete. It is easily distinguished from a standard YachtBot or YachtBot Bio by its different front label. The YachtBot rover has the orange button below the five indicator lights and features a front facing GPS antenna mount.
