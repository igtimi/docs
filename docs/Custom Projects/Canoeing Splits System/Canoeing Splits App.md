_By the time you read this article the software may have changed slightly. If there are any larger changes to the software then these pages will be updated to reflect those changes. If in doubt, just ask support@igtimi.com._

Selecting devices

Each YachtBot rover identifies to the system with a unique serial number. To include it in a split run, simply check the tick box.

Setting up parameters

For each run, you can set up total distance.

The distance of splits must be smaller than total distance but does not require to be a whole fraction of the total distance.

The Start Mode is the method you want to start the measurement. In manual mode, the operator of the Canoeing Splits App typically gives a ‘ready, set, go’ signal to the athletes and records the start time by button push.

In the Velocity Start Mode, the start time is derived from the speed profile of the first YachtBot rover.

The live view can be modified to show any combination of pace, heart rate (HRM), cadence, and wind parameters if available. The pace measure, furthermore, can be displayed in your choice of unit.
