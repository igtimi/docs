# About YachtBot devices

[YachtBot hardware](../../YachtBot%20Products/) is water and shock-proof if used correctly. All hardware should be regularly inspected for visible damage.

  

A bung must always be fitted when used near water. Make sure the bung is greased regularly (using a machine grease such as INOX) to avoid damage to the YachtBot case. Details on bung removal can be found [here](../../YachtBot%20Products/Deprecated%20articles/Removing%20YachtBot's%20bung.md). The front facing connector on YachtBot Rover and Base Station **compromises the waterproofness** of the devices when no antenna is fitted. Care around water is advised when the antenna is removed.

  

All YachtBot devices must have (large) SIM cards fitted to work with the Canoeing Splits system. The data usage is approx. between 1MB and 4MB per hour and depends on the configured update rate and sync settings and. All YachtBot devices must be registered to the appropriate YachtBot account before they become available in the Canoeing Splits App. More information on [SIM and SD cards](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals/SD%20(local%20memory%20storage)%20and%20SIM%20cards.md), [registering devices](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Registering%20Devices.md), and other generally applicable concepts can be found in the [public support articles](../../YachtBot%20Products/).

  

First time use
--------------

Preferably outside, with a full view of the sky, push the power button on the Base Station and YachtBot until you hear two beeps and see the LEDs flash. The unit is ready for use when all indicator lights have gone solid.

  

Battery
-------

On a single charge, YachtBot devices run continuously for between 10 and 12 hours. The performance is dependent on cell phone reception and GPS coverage, as the engines for both work harder when the coverage is low.
