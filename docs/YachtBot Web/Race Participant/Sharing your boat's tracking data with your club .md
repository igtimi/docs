# Sharing your boat's tracking data with your club 

This short article is aimed at sailors who are using their own YachtBot account and YachtBot Mini or YachtBot Mobile on their smartphone. We assume that you already have an [account](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Create%20your%20YachtBot%20account.md) on YachtBot and are familiar with the operation of your device or the [YachtBot Mobile App](http://support.yacht-bot.com/support/solutions/8000039800).

  

First, make sure that you [connect](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Managing%20YachtBot%20Contacts.md) with the race organiser's YachtBot account by making them a contact.

Second, [share access](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Sharing%20Devices.md) to your device with them. It's then up to them to add your device to their race.

  

Once you have set up the sharing, all you need to do is turn on your tracker before you go sailing. Easy!

To avoid having to share access before every single race, consider giving your club access to your data for all of the sailing season.   

  

Happy sailing!
