# Cellular connectivity trouble shooting

YachtBot typically connects to the YachtBot web servers within one minute of starting. The connection LED slowly flashes while it is starting up, and goes solid when connected. If the connection LED is flashing fast, this indicates that a SIM is not yet (correctly) inserted.

If YachtBot does not connect within a few minutes, here is a list of the common things to check, sorted by likelihood. If you still have trouble after going through this list, please contact us and have a zip file of the contents of your SD card ready.

## Data settings (APN, Username and Password))

YachtBot will typically find the correct settings to enable data for your SIM card.  However sometimes you may need to manually configure these using [these instructions](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20product%20family%20fundamentals/SIM%20data%20settings.md).

## Unlocked yet?

Many new pre-pay SIM’s require being unlocked or activated using SMS or a phone call before they will work in data devices.

_How?_ Check the documentation that came with your SIM card for unlock instructions.  You may need to insert the SIM into a mobile phone first, and ensure you can browse to an internet page from the cell phone.

## Got credit?

Check there is credit on the SIM. Some carriers will quote available voice calling credit and data credit separately, ensure you are checking available data credit.

_How?_ Ask your carrier.

## SIM lock?

Ensure that the SIM lock has been disabled.

_How?_ Check that when the SIM is placed in a smart phone, the phone should not request a PIN when powering up. If it does, the SIM lock can be disabled by using the phone’s SIM toolkit menu .

## On a plan?

Ensure that the SIM is not on a hardware-locked plan (typical in some countries when the carrier provides free-of-charge phones with a long term contract).

_How?_ Check that the SIM works in an unlocked smartphone, and can access the internet.

## Local Roaming?

YachtBot strongly recommends against using "budget" carriers that rely on roaming agreements with other national carriers to extend their coverage.  Choose a carrier with the best coverage in the area you are operating your devices.
