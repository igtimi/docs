# I can’t tell if my YachtBot Mini is on or off. Help!

We agree, on the 2G version of YachtBot Mini it can be tricky to distinguish between a turned off device, and one that’s perfectly connected.

  

If you don’t have ready access to yacht-bot.com to check the connection status, you can briefly push the power button.

  

In normal operation:

*   If none of the two indicators flash, the device is off (or out of battery).  
    
*   If both lights flash up briefly and turn off together, the device is on and connected.  
    
*   If only the blue light flashes briefly, the device is off (on older hardware iterations of the 2G version).  
    

  

When you're dealing with a fault or bad connection, you may see:

*   If both indicators light up, but the green data connection light keeps flashing, you likely have incorrect [APN settings](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20Mini/SIM%20card%20installation%20and%20APN.md).
