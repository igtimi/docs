# I can't turn on my YachtBot/TideBot/WindBot device. What's wrong?

Your device cannot find a firmware and is therefore not booting up.

On TideBot, you've likely done a ‘long press’ of the magnet switch, and the red light flashes but turns off again when you move the magnet. The unit never powers up.  

  

See the [firmware article](../../YachtBot%20Products/Firmware%20and%20Configuration%20Downloads/Firmware%20updates%20for%20YachtBot,%20WindBot,%20and%20TideBot.md) for latest firmware updates and instructions.
