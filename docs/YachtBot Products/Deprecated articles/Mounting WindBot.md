# Mounting WindBot

WindBot is sensitive to location on your boat. Because the True Wind calculation depends on the GPS location, any **magnetic** disturbances can influence this measurement. In practice, this means that when used on a RIB, WindBot needs to be mounted as far away from the motor as possible.

   

How to tell if WindBot is mounted incorrectly? If you can see boat movement data in your wind measurements, then your mounting location is likely incorrect. Contact us with photographs of the boat you wish to mount WindBot on and we’ll advise of best location.
