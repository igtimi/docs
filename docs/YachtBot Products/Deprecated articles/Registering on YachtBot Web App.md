# Registering on YachtBot Web App

  

All YachtBot devices need to be registered with a YachtBot account – either yours or your organization. A device can only be un-registered by the current owner.

  

Refer to the [Registering Devices](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Registering%20Devices.md) article in the YachtBot Web App section for details.
