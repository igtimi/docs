# Replacing the bungee assembly

If after lots of use the TideBot’s sails don’t spring out anymore when pulled from the storage tube, you can replace the bungee assembly with the supplied spare.

The bungee assembly holds the carbon rods under tension. Remove the old one by snipping the black shock chord that provides the tension and pull the rubber connectors from the rods. To reassemble, push the rubber connectors of the new assembly on and feed the new shock cord over the cloverleaf and back through the holes in the float. It is important to tighten both sides of the cord and secure them with a figure eight knot. All up, you need to pull out at least a foot of shock cord on each side.
