# On my YachtBot Mini the green data indicator keeps flashing? What’s wrong?

Check that the SIM card is inserted correctly, with contacts touching the metal and the lock mechanism engaged so that the card is sitting flush.

If this doesn't resolve the issue, make sure that the APN settings are correct.
