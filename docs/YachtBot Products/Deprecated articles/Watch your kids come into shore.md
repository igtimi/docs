# Watch your kids come into shore

YachtBot can be used by any sailor, or by friends and family wanting to watch a sailor. YachtBot is simple to set up, so you can start sailing straight away.

## Setup

If you want to follow your kids sailing, using your their or your mobile phone, follow these steps:

1. [Sign up to a YachtBot account](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Create%20your%20YachtBot%20account.md)

1. [Install the YachtBot Mobile App](../../YachtBot%20Products/YachtBot%20Mobile/Getting%20started.md)

Sign into the YachtBot Mobile app using the same login credentials.

## Ready to go!

When your child is heading out, run the YachtBot Mobile app and press the Big Orange button to start the tracker.

We recommend placing the phone in water- and shock-proof bags or boxes and securing it in a likely-dry place in your child's boat, where it can see the sky.

## View on your tablet

Login to YachtBot andÂ [define a simple race](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Creating%20a%20YachtBot%20race%20session.md), save and view. That's it!
