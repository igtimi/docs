### Is it on or off?

To check what state you're in, press the power button briefly. If both lights flash shortly, YachtBot Mini has a satellite fix and is connected.Â If no lights flash, the device is off or out of battery.

Applying only to 3G version: When connected, the GPS and Data indicators blink in unison every 3 seconds.

Applying only to some earlier hardware iterations: If only the blue light flashes briefly, the device is off.
