# How does YachtBot Mini work?

YachtBot Mini uses the local cell phone network to report its GPS location back to YachtBot every 3 seconds (2G version) or every second (3G version) while in cell phone coverage.

  

When not in coverage, YachtBot Mini does not communicate with our servers. In some instances, data loss is handled but not generally.

YachtBot Mini has a faster update rate than your phone, meaning it'll create a more meaningful path when rounding a mark. In comparison to most smartphones, YachtBot Mini is low-cost, making it the better choice of a device to risk having near the water.
