# Registering YachtBot Mini on YachtBot App

Like all YachtBot devices, the YachtBot Mini needs to be registered with a YachtBot account – either yours or your sailing club’s. From there, it can be used to define races or be shared with someone else. A device can only be unregistered by the current owner. Please refer to [this article](../../YachtBot%20Web/Getting%20started/Registering%20Devices.md) in the YachBot App section.
