# When I plug my YachtBot Mini into my PC’s USB port, the device shows up then disappears again. What’s wrong?

The YachtBot Mini’s USB port is only intended for charging using the supplied DC converter. Connecting it to a PC will charge it, too, however more slowly. YachtBot Mini is not registering as an appropriate USB device, so your PC will not connect to it properly.
