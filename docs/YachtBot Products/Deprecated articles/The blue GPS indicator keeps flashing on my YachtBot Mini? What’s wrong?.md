# The blue GPS indicator keeps flashing on my YachtBot Mini? What’s wrong?

Your device isn’t getting a GPS fix. This can happen if you’re inside a building or outside surrounded by tall structures or trees. On a boat, make sure the tracker can see the sky. Contact us at support@igtimi.com if the problem persists.
