# Ports on YachtBot

This article applies to YachtBot, YachtBot Bio, TideBot and WindBot.

- The SD card must be inserted for correct operation. Use the SD card that arrived with your device

- The SIM card is optional

- The USB port is used to access the SD card (there rarely is a need to remove the SD card and we advise against it) to change the config file or update the firmware, or to charge the device (this is slower than using the DC charge port)

- The DC charge port is used for charging the battery. Only use the supplied charger

- The recessedÂ reset button is for powering the device down in the unlikely event that the main button is not responsive
