# Troubleshooting Tidebot

## Transmitting version

After registering the device and inserting a SIM card, create a LIVE race on ww.yacht-bot.com.

Required equipment:

- A laptop, tablet, smartphone to view the live race

- Sufficient sky view to allow TideBot to get a GPS fix

- A compass or knowledge of True or Magnetic North direction

Now continue with the tests as described in the next section and either during or at the end of it, check the data YachtBot received and displayed.

## Non-transmitting version

To convince yourself that the TideBot is producing sensible data, enable a WCT measurement and hold the TideBot with both hands and walk briskly due north. Check the measurement while you walk.

If this fails or doesnâ€™t meet your predictions, check the declination settings in the TideBot configuration file (set to AUTO).
