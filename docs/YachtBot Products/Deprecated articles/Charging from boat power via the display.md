# Charging from boat power via the display

If powering the WindBot system from boat power, typically via a display, always start your engine before turning on the WindBot system.  

  

**Important!** When powered off boat power, WindBot can drain your boatâ€™s battery. Always turn the display off, then turn off WindBot brain before mooring for the night. If data sync is enabled (see below), WindBot brain will not shut down immediately.
