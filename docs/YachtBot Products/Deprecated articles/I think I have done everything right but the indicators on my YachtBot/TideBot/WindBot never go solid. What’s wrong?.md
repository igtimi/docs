# I think I have done everything right but the indicators on my YachtBot/TideBot/WindBot never go solid. What’s wrong?

First check that the SIM and SD cards are inserted correctly.

  

If the data indicator keeps flashing, check out the SIM card trouble shooting tips. The most common cause for problems is related to brand new SIMs being used. Put the SIM card in a conventional smart phone and make sure you can browse to websites other than that of the SIM card provider and that there is no PIN set for using mobile data. If there is a PIN, use the smart phone to remove it.

  

If the GPS indicator keeps flashing, your device isn’t getting a satellite fix. This can happen if you’re inside a building or outside surrounded by tall structures or trees. On a boat, make sure your unit brain can see the sky and be aware that carbon fibre shield signals very efficiently.
