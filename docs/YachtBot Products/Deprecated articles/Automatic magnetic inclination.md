# Automatic magnetic inclination

To get accurate True Wind readings, WindBot brain acquires the correct magnetic declination for your location and adjusts its internal compass reading. To take advantage of this feature, set   

```NAV DECLINATION AUTO ```

and make sure that your SD card is loaded with the World Magnetic Model coefficients (WMM.COF, supplied by us.) If you want to override this setting and set the declination manually, contact us.
