# I cannot see True Wind on my B&G display. Help!

Outside and in clear view of the sky, with some wind (or someone’s strong lungs blowing into a vertically supported pole), and a GPS fix, enter the main menu of your display. From there, navigate to the Data List for the NMEA converter device.

Steps:

Main menu (arrow button)

Setup

Advanced Setup

Device list

IF-NMEA…

Options

Data

This shows all the data that the WindBot sends to the display.

If you see a heading, then the IMU works. If not, then there is an issue with the IMU. Contact us.

If you see longitude and latitude, then the GPS connection works. Check that you haven’t lost the GPS fix and move outdoors. If the problem persists, contact us.

If you see TWD and TWS, True Wind works. If not, there may be a problem with the sensor. Check the connection from sensor to pole.
