Use only supplied YachtBot batteries in YachtBot Mini. Incorrect installation of battery may cause damage to YachtBot Mini.

  

**Remove battery cover:**

On rear of device, loosen the two small screws that hold on the battery cover. Remove battery cover from the device.

These screws are captive and remain in the battery cover when loose.
