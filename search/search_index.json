The protocol definitions can be found on Github . If you want to develop your own server to handle yachtbot device data, you can use the go-igtimi example server is a starting point. Introduction Connection The device connects to the server using a TCP connection. Usually port 6000 is used. Protocol Buffers The riot protocol is based on protocol buffers. Protocol Buffers were developed by Google as a \u201clanguage-neutral, platform-neutral\u201d mechanism for serializing structured data. The format is specified in .proto files, and libraries can be compiled for many common languages. For more information see the documentation at https://protobuf.dev/ . Message Types All messages sent over connections to RIoT (in both directions) will conform to the format defined by the Msg message defined in IgtimiStream.proto, whose definition is seen in code snipped 1. There are three message types defined inside which have different purposes. Channel Management is used to handle any tasks associated with managing the connection. This could include, but it not limited to Authentication, Data Subscription, etc. Data is used to send or receive data. [Unused] Data Request is used to make an explicit request for a series of datapoints. Any data that does not conform to the specification will not be understood and therefore will be dropped. We recommend using protocol buffers with supported libraries to ensure that the data is in the correct format. Message framing As protocol buffers are not self-delimiting, we take the \"standard approach\" of writing a varint message length before each message. The official Java and C++ libraries have support for this built in, and other languages may also. Device data flow The standard flow for a device connecting to a RIoT server to insert data is as follows: Connect Authenticate using Device Group Token (see Authentication) Send data points Code Snippet 1 \u2013 Igtimi Stream message format ( IgtimiStream.proto ) message Msg { oneof msg { ChannelManagement channel_management = 1 [json_name = \"mgmt\"]; Data data = 2 [json_name = \"d\"]; AckResponse ack_response = 3 [json_name = \"ackResponse\"]; APIData api_data = 4 [json_name = \"apiData\"]; DeviceManagement device_management = 5 [json_name = \"deviceManagement\"]; } } Channel Management Channel management covers all the messages required to setup and maintain the connection between the client and the RIoT node. Authentication Tokens Igtimi uses two distinct types of tokens for authentication. User token A user token is a standard OAuth 2.0 token used to authenticate a user. A user token allows a client to subscribe or request data from the system. A user token also allows the client to insert data for a session. A client may authenticate only ONE user token at a time, meaning that attempting to authenticate a 2nd token will clear the first, and any data subscriptions will be lost (regardless of ACK or NAK). Device Group Token A device group token authenticates a client to insert data for a device or group of devices. A client may authenticate using multiple device group tokens by simply sending another authentication request. Code Snippet 2 \u2013 Token message format ( IgtimiAPI.proto ) message Token { oneof token { string user_token = 1 [json_name = \"userToken\"]; string device_group_token = 2 [json_name = \"deviceGroupToken\"]; } } Request To authenticate a connection with RIoT a client should send an Authentication Request in the correct format, providing a token along with the current timestamp. The client should assume the connection is un-authenticated until a response indicating successful authentication is received. Code Snippet 3 \u2013 Authentication request message format ( IgtimiStream.proto ) message AuthRequest { uint64 timestamp = 1 [json_name = \"t\"]; Token token = 2 [json_name = \"token\"]; } Response For every authentication request there is a response. This response will indicate whether the request has been successful, along with both a machine and human readable reason. The response code is equivalent to a HTTP response code, therefore for a full list of codes and their meaning refer to the list maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Code Snippet 4 \u2013 Authentication response message format ( IgtimiStream.proto ) message AuthResponse { uint64 timestamp = 1 [json_name = \"t\"]; Token token = 2 [json_name = \"token\"]; bool ack = 3 [json_name = \"ack\"]; uint32 code = 4 [json_name = \"code\"]; string reason = 5 [json_name = \"reason\"]; } Heartbeats RIoT uses heartbeats to indicate that a connection is still active. The server sends a Channel Management heartbeat message every 15 seconds and expects to receive at least one message from the device every 30 seconds to keep the connection active. Inactive connections will be queued for disconnection. Yachtbot devices send a heartbeat message every 15 seconds and attempt to reconnect if no heartbeat messages have been received in 30 seconds. Data Format The different messages and data types are specified in IgtimiData.proto message DataMsg { // required repeated DataPoint data = 1 [json_name = \"data\"]; // not required (may be determinable from the connection) oneof source { string serial_number = 2 [json_name = \"serial\"]; uint32 session_id = 3 [json_name = \"session\"]; } // not required (server should default to 3 when not set) TypeOfService type_of_service = 4 [json_name = \"tos\"]; // not required (can be generated by the server) uint32 stream_id = 5 [json_name = \"streamID\"]; } Stream IDs Way to group data into \u201cwindows\u201d e.g. power cycle. Type of Service Bitfield. The Protocol Buffer schema specifies all options, so no bit operations are required. Bit 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Use Reserved for future use Ack Sync Update Persistent Live Rules: Must be either Live, Persistent or Both. Cannot be neither. If not set (0) default of 3 (Live + Persistent) will be applied. Source IDs (input / output) Allows data to be input from multiple sources (sensors) for the same device (e.g. dual GPS). For session data the source ID will equal the user id of the user that input the data (determined by the User Token used to authenticate). This will be enforced by RIoT so does not need to be set by the client and will be overwritten if it is set incorrectly. Data Types All data types have a timestamp (ms epoch) and one or more values. On input if the timestamp is not set (i.e. is 0), it will be set at the timestamp the server receives the message. Output data will have a timestamp for every message. GNSS Position (pos) Property TYpe Description timestamp uint64 Timestamp of the data (ms epoch) latitude double WGS 84 latitude longitude double WGS 84 longitude altitude double WGS 84 altitude (ellipsoid) fields uint32 Bit map of the valid fields. Fields Map: Describes which values in the GNSS Position message are valid as a bitfield. The bits are: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Reserved Altitude Longitude Latitude Note: Whilst the bitfield allows any combination of latitude, longitude and altitude all message must have both a valid latitude and valid longitude.

How does the WindBot calculate True Wind 2. Automatic Magnetic Inclination 3. Connecting to a permanent power supply 4. Pigtail connector 5. Access data from the WindBot for analysis 1. How does the WindBot calculate True Wind True wind is the Wind we feel when we are standing still as the wind moves across the land. This is the wind that is talked about during weather forecasts. Apparent wind, is the wind we feel when we are walking forward on a calm day. If there is no wind and we walk forward at 5kt, we will feel a wind strength of 5kt on our face. As we move around daily, the wind we feel is a combination of the True Wind and the Apparent wind we generate. If there is a breeze of 5kt coming across the land, and we walk towards that breeze at 5kt, we would feel a wind strength of 10kt on our face. The WindBot has three different sensor types to calculate what the True Wind is, even while we are moving around. The three sensors include a Global Position Sensor ( GPS ), an Inertial Measurement Unit ( IMU ) and a Wind sensor . The WindBot is able to determine the difference between the Apparent wind (the wind we feel while moving) and the True Wind (the wind on the land), by using these three sensors. The Wind sensor measures the Apparent wind that the WindBot feels. This is the same wind that you feel as you walk around. The GPS allows the WindBot to know how fast it is moving. In the first example of walking forwards at 5kt, If the Wind sensors reads 5kt, and the GPS reads a speed of 5kt, then the True Wind must be 0kt and the WindBot can calculate this. The IMU , is like a compass. The IMU can tell us what direction we are walking. In the second example when there is a True Wind of 5kt moving across the land. The compass will tell the WindBot if we are walking at 5kt away from the Wind, and would feel no wind on our face. Or if we are walking at 5kt towards the Wind and feel 10kt on our face. The WindBot needs all three sensors to be working together to calculate the True Wind. 2. Automatic Magnetic Inclination To get accurate True Wind readings, WindBot brain acquires the correct magnetic declination for your location and adjusts its internal compass reading. To take advantage of this feature, set NAV DECLINATION AUTO and make sure that your SD card is loaded with the World Magnetic Model coefficients (WMM.COF, supplied by us.) If you want to override this setting and set the declination manually, contact us. 3. Connecting to a permanent power supply For Firmware version 500 and greater. The WindBot and YachtBot Base station products can be connected to a permanent power supply to ensure they are constantly running avoiding the requirement to recharge the internal batteries. This setting makes the devices start and run when DC power is applied, then turn off when power is removed. Effectively it turns them into a \"wall powered\" device. This is particularly useful for WindBot poles on committee boats or coach RIBs, as it means they can be permanently connected and they start up automatically when the boat power is turned on at the beginning of the day. Supply of permanent power to the WindBot requires the Pigtail connector on the WindBot pole. Power cables accessories are available to purchase or the pin out information is available here . To supply permanent power to the YachtBot Base station, use the supplied charging pack. This will require the water proofing bung to be removed, so the YachtBot base station will not be water proof while running with permanent power. NOTE: Plugging in a USB cable will not supply permanent power to the devices. This feature is enabled by adding \"POWER WIRED\" to the config.ini file. POWER WIRED takes some options, examples as follows: POWER WIRED # Will shut down 5 seconds after power fails. POWER WIRED DELAY <x> # <x> in minutes, how long the device will continue to operate when power fails. POWER WIRED UPS # Operate as long as battery allows when power fails. In all these cases, when power is restored the device will start-up again. The power button can: - Be safely used to power off, then on, a device that is running in POWER WIRED mode while the power connected. This allows operators to power cycle a device for troubleshooting, and the device will continue in POWER WIRED mode because power was present at the moment when the operator restarted the device . - Start a device that does not have power connected, even while in POWER WIRED mode. In this case it will detect that it had no power when it started, and operate just once in POWER PORTABLE mode instead. This means that if power is later connected and removed, it will still run until the battery is flat, but once this has happened, it will still start automatically if power is applied again. To switch between modes, POWER WIRED can be cancelled by setting POWER PORTABLE (the default). Note that the power mode is a persistent setting, which means; - once set it will continue even if the command is removed from the configuration, and\\ - if the power mode is changed the device will need to be power cycled once to run and apply the command. In the event of extreme battery depletion the battery is completely disconnected to preserve it. POWER WIRED now handles this case too, and the device will also start normally from this condition when power is applied. 4. Pigtail connector The top section of your pole may be fitted with a pigtail cable, allowing data to be read out to a standalone display. We use a Switchcraft \"Cord Female\" connector EN3C8FX, the mating connector on the WindBot brain is a Switchcraft \"Inline Male\" EN3L8MX. Pigtail Function Notes 1 GND 2 - 3 TXD/OUT 4800 8n1 (NMEA0183) 4 12V out 300mA limit. Could be used to power wireless Bluetooth dongle. 5 CHG 8V-16V, 5W 6 GPIO/IO_IN 7 GPIO/IO_OUT 8 Shield 5. Access data from the WindBot for analysis The WindBot allows access to the raw data both directly from the pole and through the www.yacht-bot.com website. Access live data directly from the pole WHen the WindBot pole is operating is sends live raw data in a NMEA0183 format data through either the Pig tail connector, or wirelessly using Bluetooth. The pole outputs the following message types... rmc - Recommended Minimum Navigation Information\\ gga - Global Positioning System\\ zda - Time and Date\\ mwva or mwvt - Wind Speed and Angle ; AW (AWS/AWA); MWVA = Relative, MWVT = Theoretical\\ mwd - Wind Direction & Speed; TW (TWS/TWD)\\ vtg - COG/SOG\\ hdgm - Magnetic heading\\ vdr - Current Set and Drift; See 'Water Current' section\\ wpl - Waypoints; used for 'Water Current' events A full description of the format of NMEA0183 messages can be found here... https://www.tronico.fi/OH6NT/docs/NMEA0183.pdf Access logged data directly from the pole The WindBot logs the NMEA format messages to *.nma log files stored on local memory.

This allows operators to power cycle a device for troubleshooting, and the device will continue in POWER WIRED mode because power was present at the moment when the operator restarted the device . - Start a device that does not have power connected, even while in POWER WIRED mode. In this case it will detect that it had no power when it started, and operate just once in POWER PORTABLE mode instead. This means that if power is later connected and removed, it will still run until the battery is flat, but once this has happened, it will still start automatically if power is applied again. To switch between modes, POWER WIRED can be cancelled by setting POWER PORTABLE (the default). Note that the power mode is a persistent setting, which means; - once set it will continue even if the command is removed from the configuration, and\\ - if the power mode is changed the device will need to be power cycled once to run and apply the command. In the event of extreme battery depletion the battery is completely disconnected to preserve it. POWER WIRED now handles this case too, and the device will also start normally from this condition when power is applied.","title":"3.

Pigtail connector"},{"location":"YachtBot%20Products/WindBot/FAQ/","text":"FAQ What is the best way to mount WindBot? WindBot is sensitive to location on your boat. Because the True Wind calculation depends on the GPS location, any magnetic disturbances can influence this measurement. In practice, this means that when used on a RIB, WindBot needs to be mounted as far away from the motor as possible. How to tell if WindBot is mounted incorrectly? If you can see boat movement data in your wind measurements, then your mounting location is likely incorrect. Contact us with photographs of the boat you wish to mount WindBot on and we\u2019ll advise of best location. What do the power light blips mean? There are some helpful error codes that are displayed by the power light indicator, which will flash to indicate an error. Light Blips Meaning 5 WindBot stopped calculating True Wind 6 Not receiving apparent Wind from Wind Sonic sensor 7 Not receiving IMU (Compass) data 9 Not receiving GPS data Hierarchy: Codes with higher numbers trump those with lower numbers. When I try to turn the WindBot brain on by pressing the power button, the red light flashes but turns off when I let go of the button. The unit never powers up. Your device cannot find a firmware and is therefore not booting up. See our support website for the latest firmware updates and instructions. How do I power WindBot from boat power? The WindBot can be powered from boat power using a power cable that connects the boat's battery to the pigtail on the windpole. If powering the WindBot system from boat power, typically via a display (old Nanuk displays), always start your engine before turning on the WindBot system. Important! When powered off boat power, WindBot can drain your boat\u2019s battery. Always turn the display off, then turn off WindBot brain before mooring for the night. If data sync is enabled (see below), WindBot brain will not shut down immediately. How can I check the fidelity of wind measurements? On a boat, with a steady onshore wind, test the device by driving a square shaped pattern in sufficient wind, aiming for the heading to change by about 90 degrees while the wind value remains the same (within a few degrees). I don't have a display, how can I troubleshoot WindBot? After registering the device and inserting a SIM card, create a LIVE race on ww.yacht-bot.com. Required equipment: A laptop, tablet, smartphone to view the live race Sufficient sky view to allow WindBot to get a GPS fix A compass or knowledge of True or Magnetic North direction Now continue with the tests as described in Dry and Wet troubleshooting tips . How do I attach the wind sensor? The sensor typically arrives attached to the top section of the pole. Unless absolutely required, we recommend never removing it. When assembling the sensor to the top of the pole, make it so that the red mark is pointing at the same side as the WindBot brain. The screw holes are distributed unevenly around the circumference of the fitting to ensure this.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"YachtBot%20Products/WindBot/FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"YachtBot%20Products/WindBot/FAQ/#what-is-the-best-way-to-mount-windbot","text":"WindBot is sensitive to location on your boat.

Please only undertake this process in consultation with Igtimi and YachtBot staff. Before starting please ensure you have emailed info@igtimi.com. Please read this full page before you undertake this process. This process requires files to be emailed to Igtimi Staff and a time arranged for Igtimi Staff to access the WindBot Brain remotely. This process may take a few days to complete. Ensure that you are running firmware version Build 512 (Published 9 May 2019) or greater before using the process detailed in the article. The latest firmware can be found here . Plug the WindBot brain into a computer using the USB cable. Backup your existing config.ini file and copy the calibration config.ini from here . Take just the two top sections of the WindBot off your boat. In an outside space away from all metallic objects, lash the middle section of the pole against something to securely keep the poles vertical without any wobble. If you have multiple poles, use the Pole that the WindBot brain is normally attached to. Please take a photo of this process so we can confirm that there are no interfering objects nearby. Tape or role the Velcro between the poles out of the way. Turn on the Brain wait until the GPS light on the brain stops flashing. Slowly unscrew the top section of the pole by two complete turns slowly so the brain moves through at least 720 degrees. Then slowly screw it back down Repeat this three to four times over two minutes. Turn off the brain. During this process the WindBot brain will log the rotational movement.

Unboxing If this is a brand new system, please ensure that you have received all components, and that everything is intact before beginning setup. You should have: YachtBot tracker Power supply USB cable Initial setup Before deploying your YachtBot, we recommend first fully charging the unit, and installing a SIM card. Note: The SIM card is large form factor, and requires an active data plan. Check out our related articles on SIM cards , APN settings , and trouble shooting advice . To charge your device, remove the bung from the base of the unit, and connect the supplied charger. For a 'how-to' on bung removal, watch on YouTube: YachtBot Bung Removal To install your SIM card, with the bung removed from the unit, insert the SIM card into the right hand side slot. The left hand slot is for a MIcro SD card, and should already be installed. Note: This SD card is required for the device to run, so do make sure it is installed. With your device charged, and SIM card installed, re-install the waterproofing bung. The YachtBot is not waterproof without the bung installed. Powering on YachtBot To turn on your YachtBot, head outside, with a full view of the sky and push the power button on the YachtBot until you hear two beeps and see the 2nd and 3rd LEDs flash. The device is now looking for GPS signal and checking the data connection. For the data server to recognize the YachtBot, both indicators must flash while connecting and then go solid when successfully connected. Powering off YachtBot To turn off your YachtBot, press and hold the power button until the unit beeps. The unit will then begin to shutdown. The lights may continue to flash for a while after, as the unit is synchronizing cached data to the cloud. Recording heart rate YachtBot Bio can record heart rate, using the heart rate strap, via Bluetooth. To set this up visit the Recording Heart Rate with YachtBot Bio page. Recording audio YachtBot Bio can record audio, using the throat mic, via Bluetooth. To set this up visit the Using audio with YachtBot Bio page.

After recording to YachtBot's memory, you can upload the data to the YachtBot website. The audio data is available for playback with perfect synchronisation to GPS, heart rate, and (optionally) IMU data. This article explains how to configure your YachtBot Bio and facilitate the uploading of audio data files. When using two headsets it is also possible to use the headsets as an intercom, check the configuration details at the end of this article. Audio hardware YachtBot Bio works with most consumer Bluetooth headset/microphones that support Bluetooth Classic (Version 4.x) HFP profile. Bluetooth Low Energy (Version 5.x) headsets are not supported. The quality of headsets varies dramatically and some trial and error may be required to find the best match for your specific application. We recommend starting with for example the Jabra EasyGo as an economical option with good performance. Setup Clearing Pairings To clear pairings of all devices, push the power button on YachtBot seven times. After a couple of seconds YachtBot Bio emits a long beep to indicate that all existing pairings have been cleared. YachtBot Bio now does not record any audio or heart rate until a new headset has been paired. Note that button pushes should be made at a rate of 1-2 presses per second. Pairing To pair a YachtBot Bio with a headset requires asking both YachtBot Bio and the headset to enter \"pairing mode\" using two simple steps; YachtBot Bio: With YachtBot Bio running, push the power button 5 times. The Audio indicator blinks intermittently. Headset (model dependent): usually power up and press and hold the button. If you are pairing a brand-new headset, just turn it on immediately after YachtBot Bio is in pairing mode. Most new headsets will pair by default out of the box. If pairing is successful, YachtBot Bio emits a long beep after about 10-15 seconds. If you don't hear the beep, then pairing was not successful, try again. YachtBot Bio searches for headsets during a 10 second period after step 1), so it is important that both steps are done in reasonably quick succession. If wanting to pair to a second device, repeat the process again. YachtBot Bio will remember up to eight pairings. The first one or two devices to connect will be recorded. Recording Audio Once pairing was successful, all that is necessary to record audio is turn on the Bluetooth headset while YachtBot Bio is running. The audio indicator will blink slowly until the first audio device connects, and then it will come on solid. If at any point audio is lost (out of range, battery flat on headset) then the audio indicator will blink quickly until the connection is re-established. How do you make sure you stay connected? Most Bluetooth headsets will only try reconnect for a couple of minutes after moving out of range. To reconnect manually it is usually necessary to manually reconnect by (typically) pressing the button on the headset. Most Bluetooth headsets will indicate that they have a connection with some kind of visual indicator (a blue blinking light), and will announce this through the speaker as a beep or voice message such as \"connected\". Upload and playback Audio files will be recorded as a file with a .wv extension . To upload these files to the YachtBot website, plug YachtBot Bio into a USB port and wait ~10 seconds. An external drive will mount with contents typically as shown here: File names The file prefix \"000000a2\" is the Stream ID, which is a unique number that increases each time YachtBot Bio is powered up. The suffix _01 indicates a particular recording during that power cycle of YachtBot Bio. If a headset goes out of range and reconnects then this number will increase. In this example, we have two audio files - one in each per power cycle. Copy the audio files to your hard drive for temporary storage. Uploading To upload the files, log in to the YachtBot website, then go to Upload Files in the Devices section. After uploading the files, please wait for the files to be processed and made available.

Multipath error , caused by the signal bouncing on objects and the water, and resulting in a messy signal, becomes a limiting factor. Manufacturers like to quote GPS positioning performance figures assuming perfect, laboratory-like conditions, which is not usually a close match to the real-world sailing environment. On larger boats it is possible to get close to \u201cperfect\u201d by installing high quality (larger) antenna clear behind the stern of the yacht. For smaller boats this is not possible and the quality of the tracking equipment determines the overall performance. In summary, your mileage may vary and buyer beware! We recommend exercising caution when reviewing glossy accuracy results. Contact us at info@igimi.com if your questions about GPS accuracy aren't answered below, or if you would like advise for your particular situation. The solution: YachtBot product family YachtBot's key features enable the highest positioning accuracy possible for dinghy racing and other equally challenging environments. We offer three hardware products for tracking yachts; YachtBot, YachtBot Bio and YachtBot Mini. These are designed specifically for temporary installation on small dinghy style boats, with internal batteries and antenna. On demand, we supply YachtBot as system with external antenna, and the ability to add an external power source for permanent installation. YachtBot, YachtBot Bio,the WindBot and TideBot systems, are compatible with the choices of GPS modules listed below. YachtBot vs. phone grade GPS A walk in the park The figure on the right demonstrates the differences between a consumer grade GPS in a cell phone (or also YachtBot Mini), and a YachtBot. The data was gathered at the same time. The red line is a cell phone; the pink line is a YachtBot Bio with a standard module. At the start line The figure below is a good example for a typical start-line situation, with many boats in close proximity. We zig-zagged through the catamarans with the tracking gear mounted on a laser mast. Note the two YachtBot\u2019s have a very clean pattern in this difficult test. The Android phone performs badly, with many boat lengths of error. This is because phones have very poor performance in this high-multipath environment. Out on the boat As an example of comparative GPS performance in the best possible conditions, consider the image below. There are two YachtBots co-located (Blue/Purple) on one vessel, and the Android phone co-located with a YachtBot Bio on another. This snapshot demonstrates some of the worst phone grade behaviour. In the same session the worst error for the YachtBot\u2019s was about \u00be of a boat length. Choosing the right accuracy for YachtBot One of the unique features of the YachtBot hardware is that it can be equipped with a range of GPS modules to suit different resolution requirements. In increasing accuracy, the four options are (with phone grade accuracy listed for completion): # Option Technology GPS Type Accuracy RMS (m) Base station Notes 0 Phone grade Autonomous Consumer ~10.0 No As found in most smart phones and YachtBot Mini, using GPS only 1 Standard Autonomous Consumer 3.0 No Using GPS+GLONASS 2 SBAS Autonomous/SBAS Precision 1.7/0.5 No 0.5m accuracy only in areas of SBAS coverage 3 Differential PSRDIFF Precision 0.5 Yes 4 RTK RTK Precision 0.05 RMS + 1PPM Yes When accuracy is not the paramount concern, consider the YachtBot Mini for tracking sailing races. We support many races using YachtBot Mini, ask us for a recent example race. Upgrades Upgrades between option 2 to 4 are by firmware unlock, the hardware requires no modification. Glossary & Notes Term Note GPS Global Positioning System. Used synonymically with everything satellite, it is in fact the American system. GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite System. Russian equivalent of GPS. SBAS \u201cSpace Based Augmentation Service\u201d \u2013 more commonly known as WAAS in the USA and EGNOS in the EU. It provides correction data direct from the satellite in many areas (see map ) at no extra cost. DGPS \u201cDifferential GPS\u201d \u2013 it provides correction data from a DGPS base station. Requires a DGPS base station, and the data is delivered automatically to the YachtBot over the internet and cell phone network via our web portal service. RTK \u201cReal Time Kinematics\u201d \u2013 similar to DGPS, but more accurate. Requires an RTK base station, and the data is delivered automatically to the YachtBot over the internet and cell phone network via our web portal service. GPS+GLONASS With most GPS tracking systems it\u2019s possible to see up to maximum of 15 satellites at any one time. However, the average number of visible satellites is less than 10, and it\u2019s normal to have as low as 5 or 6 satellites visible at any given time. When coupled with a restricted sky view due to roll/pitch, and other obstructions, it\u2019s normal for GPS accuracy to be severely compromised, or drop out altogether, in the real-world sailing environment. In addition to GPS, YachtBot also uses GLONASS for positioning. Adding GLONASS positioning capability means that more satellites are visible in the sky \u2013 up to eight times more! This means more accuracy, and fewer \u201cbrown-outs\u201d. This applies to options 1 - 4.

If you are responsible for preparing devices for use overseas, then it is a good idea to check the data settings are correct in advance to help ensure that any remote support is keep to a minimum.

GPS rate HDGM (magnetic heading) information, from the orientation estimation, is available for visualisation on the YachtBot web portal or via the Igtimi API for cloud based data access. Full rate orientation and kinematic data may be logged in a NMEA format compatible CSV logfile. Orientation estimation The goal of orientation estimation is to report the attitude of YachtBot relative to the frame defined by the earth's surface and magnetic north. Orientation can be reported as Euler angles or Quaternions and the \"zero\" orientation is when YachtBot's mounting frame of reference (see Mounting options) is flat to the earth and pointing north. The orientation estimation uses an algorithm that includes Kalman filtering techniques. Raw sensor data input is oversampled, and final estimations low pass filtered to remove unwanted impulse noise and vibration. Mounting options YachtBot can be mounted in several different orthogonal orientations which are configured via the IMU AXES \\[DECK/BOW/STERN/PORT/STARBOARD\\] command. The argument describes the surface of the object that the rear surface of YachtBot is to be mounted against. The GPS antenna should always be pointing up, except for DECK mount, where it should be pointing towards the bow. The option only affects the orientation data, not the kinematic data. Raw kinematic data Linear acceleration and gyro information may be logged. Linear acceleration can be logged with, or without the static gravity vector included. This is not affected by the mounting option and will use the natural axis of the IMU. For details about the natural axis refer to the attached pdf on mounting options: Yachtbot Mounting options Calibration and accuracy The AHRS has been factory calibrated to correct for linear and non-linear errors in the sensors. Each YachtBot passes calibration testing if 4-points static heading errors are less than 0.5 degrees in a ferritic-free environment. Zero point offset First order Euler angle offsets can be set using the IMU PYR command, and can account for any fixed offset errors due to remaining zero offsets in the orientation estimation, or due to mounting alignments. Note that a first order correction is only suitable for small corrections. Where large mounting errors are present, post-processing rotation of the orientation estimation is recommended. Note that the Euler angle orientation estimation outputs with non-orthogonal mounting are still valid, but the parameters no longer map directly to the physical properties expected of Pitch/Roll/Yaw. See Yachtbot Mounting options Drift and zeroing of the reference frame YachtBot estimates reference vectors that define the orientation of the earth frame. These reference vectors are determined at power-up and continuously corrected. To ensure that the reference vectors are correctly determined, it's important that YachtBot should be powered up while stationary. Magnetic declination Orientation is measured relative to magnetic north. The angle between magnetic north and true north is called magnetic declination. Where yaw/heading needs to be referenced to true north, using NOAA's empirical declination model is recommend. http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/geomag.shtml Live Data Magnetic heading (HDGM) is transmitted live to the YachtBot server directly using the Yaw field from the Euler angle output. To enable HDGM output in YachtBot, Euler angle messages must be enabled and the mounting configuration correctly configured. The maximum rate for HDGM data is defined by the GPS rate, and it is recommended to set the Euler angle message rate at the same rate as, or multiple of, the GPS rate. An example enabling the Euler message for HDGM is: IMU MESSAGE EULER 1 log 1 live which would set the eular rate to that of the IMU. Logfile AHRS data is logged to \\ .IMU.NMA. The Steam ID is a monotonically increasing number which is incremented each power cycle.

A forward slash inside square brackets means \"or\". For example, [DECK/BOW] means the argument is optional, or can be either DECK or BOW. IMU RATE \\[<rate>\\] Read (no args), or set, the native (maximum) query rate for IMU in Hz. IMU MESSAGE <type> \\[<divider>\\] \\[log\\] Read (no args) or set message types to query IMU for. The message type is requested at a rate defined by / . If [log] is set, the message will be logged to the IMU logfile. Default argument values are = 1 and log disabled. IMU MESSAGE <type> off Disable querying IMU for message . This is the default setting for all message types. IMU EULER PYR \\[<pitch> <yaw> <roll>\\] Read (no args), or set, offsets that are added to Euler angles from the orientation estimation. IMU AXES \\[DECK/BOW/STERN/PORT/STARBOARD\\] Read (no args), or set, the installation orientation of YachtBot on the object to be tracked. The argument describes the surface of the object that the rear of YachtBot is to be mounted against.
