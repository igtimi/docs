Pairing YachtBot  To pair YachtBot with TalkBot, power on the YachtBot device.   Once YachtBot has powered up, press the power button 5 times. This will put the YachtBot in pairing mode, and the Bluetooth indicator should be blip quickly.  Once the pairing is complete, the Bluetooth indicator on the YachtBot should return to flashing slowly. This indicates that the pairing is complete.  See below for clarification on expected indicator behavior on both YachtBot and TalkBot devices.      Connecting YachtBot  If your YachtBot has already been paired to TalkBot, simply power on your YachtBot and connection to TalkBot should be automatic.  See below for expected indicator behavior on both TalkBot and YachtBot devices.     Expected indicator behavior  TalkBot \"Recording\" indicator will remain off until an active connection is made to YachtBot for recording. YachtBot will flash the Bluetooth indicator slowly until TalkBot makes an active recording connection.   The recording connection will only occur when one or more Athlete headsets are connected to TalkBot and at least one headset is active.   When an Athlete headset is active and connected to TalkBot, the Bluetooth indicator on the YachtBot should be solid to indicate an active recording. The \"Recording\" indicator on TalkBot should also be illuminated. YachtBot is now recording the Athlete audio from TalkBot.  This behavior prevents YachtBot from recording long periods of silence when the Athlete headset is not active.     Turning off TalkBot  To power off TalkBot, press and hold the power button until you hear a single beep. TalkBot will begin its shutdown sequence, with the power indicator flashing slowly.  Once the shutdown sequence is complete, the power indicator will turn off.

Mac OSX:     If you haven't already downloaded and install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. This program was developed and tested using python version 3.5.2 and therefore this is the recommended version to download and install.     Once python is installed, open the terminal (can found in Applications/Utilities) and type the following:  pip install matplotlib PyQt5     note: Python 2.7 may come pre-installed on OSX. See the section below about using both python 2 and 3.     Additional Info:     Python 2 vs 3     Python 3 is required for this program due to some of the libraries used. If you are already using python 2 you can still install python 3. To check which version of python you are running type  python --version  into command prompt (terminal on a mac). If you are on a mac you can specify the version in the command  pip3  install matplotlib PyQt5\r\npython3 TurnAnalyser.pyw     On a windows computer please refer to this python help document https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html.

After recording to YachtBot's memory, you can upload the data to the YachtBot website. The audio data is available for playback with perfect synchronisation to GPS, heart rate, and (optionally) IMU data. This article explains how to configure your YachtBot Bio and facilitate the uploading of audio data files.     When using two headsets it is also possible to use the headsets as an intercom, check the configuration details at the end of this article.     Audio hardware  YachtBot Bio works with most consumer Bluetooth headset/microphones that support Bluetooth Classic (Version 4.x) HFP  profile.  Bluetooth Low Energy (Version 5.x) headsets are not supported.  The quality of headsets varies dramatically and some trial and error may be required to find the best match for your specific application. We recommend starting with for example the Jabra EasyGo as an economical option with good performance.     Setup     Clearing Pairings  To clear pairings of all devices, push the power button on YachtBot seven times. After a couple of seconds YachtBot Bio emits a long beep to indicate that all existing pairings have been cleared. YachtBot Bio now does not record any audio or heart rate until a new headset has been paired. Note that button pushes should be made at a rate of 1-2 presses per second.     Pairing  To pair a YachtBot Bio with a headset requires asking both YachtBot Bio and the headset to enter \"pairing mode\"  using two simple steps;    YachtBot Bio: With YachtBot Bio running, push the power button 5 times. The Audio indicator blinks intermittently.   Headset (model dependent): usually power up and press and hold the button.    If you are pairing a brand-new headset, just turn it on immediately after YachtBot Bio is in pairing mode. Most new headsets will pair by default out of the box.      If pairing is successful, YachtBot Bio emits a long beep after about 10-15 seconds. If you don't hear the beep, then pairing was not successful, try again. YachtBot Bio searches for headsets during a 10 second period after step 1), so it is important that both steps are done in reasonably quick succession.     If wanting to pair to a second device, repeat the process again. YachtBot Bio will remember up to eight pairings. The first one or two devices to connect will be recorded.     Recording Audio   Once pairing was successful, all that is necessary to record audio is turn on the Bluetooth headset while YachtBot Bio is running. The audio indicator will blink slowly until the first audio device connects, and then it will come on solid.  If at any point audio is lost (out of range, battery flat on headset) then the audio indicator will blink  quickly until the connection is re-established.     How do you make sure you stay connected?   Most Bluetooth headsets will only try reconnect for a couple of minutes after moving out of range. To reconnect manually it is usually necessary to manually reconnect by (typically) pressing the button on the headset.  Most Bluetooth headsets will indicate that they have a connection with some kind of visual indicator (a blue blinking light), and will announce this through the speaker as a beep or voice message such as \"connected\".      Upload and playback  Audio files will be recorded as a file with a .wv extension. To upload these files to the YachtBot website, plug YachtBot Bio into a USB port and wait ~10 seconds. An external drive will mount with contents typically as shown here:          File names  The file prefix \"000000a2\" is the Stream ID, which is a unique number that increases each time YachtBot Bio is powered up. The suffix _01 indicates a particular recording during that power cycle of YachtBot Bio. If a headset goes out of range and reconnects then this number will increase. In this example, we have two audio files - one in each per power cycle. Copy the audio files to your hard drive for temporary storage.     Uploading  To upload the files, log in to the YachtBot website, then go to Upload Files in the Devices section.             After uploading the files, please wait for the files to be processed and made available. This could take some time if the files are large.     At any stage you can check on progress by clicking on one of the status categories (see below) and refreshing your browser.     Uploading  Audio is still being uploaded from the browser to the server.     Pending  Audio files here were recorded without GPS time synchronisation, or are otherwise invalid and cannot be used     Processing  Files are being processed… please wait.     Uploaded  Reports on how many files have been uploaded for each device.     IMAGE ABOVE SHOWS ONLY UPLOADED FILES.     In race editor and viewer  Once you make a race with a device that has audio uploaded to it, you see a symbol next to the device in the race editor. When viewing the session you see a coloured bar for each audio device just above the time slider at the bottom. When the viewer is playing anywhere where there is a bar, audio starts automatically and is synchronised as you navigate. No need to wait for the audio to download, it streams automatically as it plays. Note that audio will mute unless it’s playing at 1x speed.

Automatic Magnetic Inclination</span></strong></h3><p><br></p><p>To get accurate True Wind readings, WindBot brain acquires the correct magnetic declination for your location and adjusts its internal compass reading. To take advantage of this feature, set </p><p><br></p><pre rel=\"highlighter\">NAV DECLINATION AUTO</pre><p>  </p><p>and make sure that your SD card is loaded with the World Magnetic Model coefficients (WMM.COF, supplied by us.) If you want to override this setting and set the declination manually, contact us.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">3. Connecting to a permanent power supply</span></strong></h3><p><em>For Firmware version 500 and greater.</em></p><p><br></p><p>The WindBot and YachtBot Base station products can be connected to a permanent power supply to ensure they are constantly running avoiding the requirement to recharge the internal batteries.</p><p><br></p><p>This setting makes the devices start and run when DC power is applied, then turn off when power is removed. Effectively it turns them into a \"wall powered\" device. This is particularly useful for WindBot poles on committee boats or coach RIBs, as it means they can be permanently connected and they start up automatically when the boat power is turned on at the beginning of the day. </p><p><br></p><p>Supply of permanent power to the WindBot requires the Pigtail connector on the WindBot pole. Power cables accessories are available to purchase or the pin out information is available <a href=\"http://support.yacht-bot.com/solution/articles/8000014253-pigtail-connector\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>To supply permanent power to the YachtBot Base station, use the supplied charging pack.  This will require the water proofing bung to be removed, so the YachtBot base station will not be water proof while running with permanent power.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: Plugging in a USB cable will not supply permanent power to the devices.</p><p><br></p><p>This feature is enabled by adding \"POWER WIRED\" to the config.ini file.</p><p><br>POWER WIRED takes some options, examples as follows:<br><br></p><pre data-code-brush=\"text\" rel=\"highlighter\">POWER WIRED             # Will shut down 5 seconds after power fails.\nPOWER WIRED DELAY &lt;x&gt;   # &lt;x&gt; in minutes, how long the device will continue to operate when power fails.\nPOWER WIRED UPS         # Operate as long as battery allows when power fails.</pre><p><br>In all these cases, when power is restored the device will start-up again.<br><br>The power button can:</p><p><br>- Be safely used to power off, then on, a device that is running in POWER WIRED mode while the power connected. This allows operators to power cycle a device for troubleshooting, and the device will continue in POWER WIRED mode because power was present <em>at the moment when the operator restarted the device</em>.</p><p><br>- Start a device that does not have power connected, even while in POWER WIRED mode. In this case it will detect that it had no power when it started, and operate <em>just once </em>in POWER PORTABLE mode instead. This means that if power is later connected and removed, it will still run until the battery is flat, but once this has happened, it will still start automatically if power is applied again.<br><br><br>To switch between modes, POWER WIRED can be cancelled by setting POWER PORTABLE (the default). Note that the power mode is a persistent setting, which means;<br><br>- once set it will continue even if the command is removed from the configuration, and<br>- if the power mode is changed the device will need to be power cycled once to run and apply the command.<br><br>In the event of extreme battery depletion the battery is completely disconnected to preserve it. POWER WIRED now handles this case too, and the device will also start normally from this condition when power is applied. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>4.

How does the WindBot calculate True Wind  2. Automatic Magnetic Inclination  3. Connecting to a permanent power supply  4. Pigtail connector  5. Access data from the WindBot for analysis           1. How does the WindBot calculate True Wind     True wind is the Wind we feel when we are standing still as the wind moves across the land.  This is the wind that is talked about during weather forecasts.     Apparent wind, is the wind we feel when we are walking forward on a calm day.   If there is no wind and we walk forward at 5kt, we will feel a wind strength of 5kt on our face.       As we move around daily, the wind we feel is a combination of the True Wind and the Apparent wind we generate.  If there is a breeze of 5kt coming across the land, and we walk towards that breeze at 5kt, we would feel a wind strength of 10kt on our face.       The WindBot has three different sensor types to calculate what the True Wind is, even while we are moving around.  The three sensors include a Global Position Sensor (GPS), an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Wind sensor.  The WindBot is able to determine the difference between the Apparent wind (the wind we feel while moving) and the True Wind (the wind on the land), by using these three sensors.     The Wind sensor measures the Apparent wind that the WindBot feels.  This is the same wind that you feel as you walk around.     The GPS allows the WindBot to know how fast it is moving.  In the first example of walking forwards at 5kt, If the Wind sensors reads 5kt, and the GPS reads a speed of 5kt, then the True Wind must be 0kt and the WindBot can calculate this.     The IMU, is like a compass.  The IMU can tell us what direction we are walking.   In the second example when there is a True Wind of 5kt moving across the land.  The compass will tell the WindBot if we are walking at 5kt away from the Wind, and would feel no wind on our face.  Or if we are walking at 5kt towards the Wind and feel 10kt on our face.     The WindBot needs all three sensors to be working together to calculate the True Wind.              2. Automatic Magnetic Inclination     To get accurate True Wind readings, WindBot brain acquires the correct magnetic declination for your location and adjusts its internal compass reading. To take advantage of this feature, set      NAV DECLINATION AUTO      and make sure that your SD card is loaded with the World Magnetic Model coefficients (WMM.COF, supplied by us.) If you want to override this setting and set the declination manually, contact us.              3. Connecting to a permanent power supply  For Firmware version 500 and greater.     The WindBot and YachtBot Base station products can be connected to a permanent power supply to ensure they are constantly running avoiding the requirement to recharge the internal batteries.     This setting makes the devices start and run when DC power is applied, then turn off when power is removed. Effectively it turns them into a \"wall powered\" device. This is particularly useful for WindBot poles on committee boats or coach RIBs, as it means they can be permanently connected and they start up automatically when the boat power is turned on at the beginning of the day.      Supply of permanent power to the WindBot requires the Pigtail connector on the WindBot pole. Power cables accessories are available to purchase or the pin out information is available here.     To supply permanent power to the YachtBot Base station, use the supplied charging pack.  This will require the water proofing bung to be removed, so the YachtBot base station will not be water proof while running with permanent power.     NOTE: Plugging in a USB cable will not supply permanent power to the devices.     This feature is enabled by adding \"POWER WIRED\" to the config.ini file.   POWER WIRED takes some options, examples as follows:    POWER WIRED             # Will shut down 5 seconds after power fails.\nPOWER WIRED DELAY <x>   # <x> in minutes, how long the device will continue to operate when power fails.\nPOWER WIRED UPS         # Operate as long as battery allows when power fails.   In all these cases, when power is restored the device will start-up again.  The power button can:   - Be safely used to power off, then on, a device that is running in POWER WIRED mode while the power connected. This allows operators to power cycle a device for troubleshooting, and the device will continue in POWER WIRED mode because power was present at the moment when the operator restarted the device.   - Start a device that does not have power connected, even while in POWER WIRED mode. In this case it will detect that it had no power when it started, and operate just once in POWER PORTABLE mode instead. This means that if power is later connected and removed, it will still run until the battery is flat, but once this has happened, it will still start automatically if power is applied again.   To switch between modes, POWER WIRED can be cancelled by setting POWER PORTABLE (the default). Note that the power mode is a persistent setting, which means;  - once set it will continue even if the command is removed from the configuration, and - if the power mode is changed the device will need to be power cycled once to run and apply the command.  In the event of extreme battery depletion the battery is completely disconnected to preserve it. POWER WIRED now handles this case too, and the device will also start normally from this condition when power is applied.               4. Pigtail connector     The top section of your pole may be fitted with a pigtail cable, allowing data to be read out to a standalone display.     We use a Switchcraft \"Cord Female\" connector EN3C8FX, the mating connector on the WindBot brain is a Switchcraft \"Inline Male\" EN3L8MX.

Access data from the WindBot for analysis  The WindBot allows access to the raw data both directly from the pole and through the www.yacht-bot.com website.     Access live data directly from the pole  WHen the WindBot pole is operating is sends live raw data in a NMEA0183 format data through either the Pig tail connector, or wirelessly  using Bluetooth.  The pole outputs the following message types...   rmc - Recommended Minimum Navigation Information gga - Global Positioning System zda - Time and Date mwva or mwvt - Wind Speed and Angle ; AW (AWS/AWA); MWVA = Relative, MWVT = Theoretical mwd - Wind Direction & Speed; TW (TWS/TWD) vtg - COG/SOG hdgm - Magnetic heading  vdr - Current Set and Drift; See 'Water Current' section wpl  - Waypoints; used for 'Water Current' events     A full description of the format of NMEA0183 messages can be found here... https://www.tronico.fi/OH6NT/docs/NMEA0183.pdf     Access logged data directly from the pole  The WindBot logs the NMEA format messages to *.nma log files stored on local memory.   Help on access the local memory is here.  Additional information on the additional sensor time stamping is here.

Effectively it turns them into a \"wall powered\" device. This is particularly useful for WindBot poles on committee boats or coach RIBs, as it means they can be permanently connected and they start up automatically when the boat power is turned on at the beginning of the day.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Supply of permanent power to the WindBot requires the Pigtail connector on the WindBot pole. Power cables accessories are available to purchase or the pin out information is available <a href=\"http://support.yacht-bot.com/solution/articles/8000014253-pigtail-connector\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>To supply permanent power to the YachtBot Base station, use the supplied charging pack. &nbsp;This will require the water proofing bung to be removed, so the YachtBot base station will not be water proof while running with permanent power.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: Plugging in a USB cable will not supply permanent power to the devices.</p><p><br></p><p>This feature is enabled by adding \"POWER WIRED\" to the config.ini file.</p><p><br>POWER WIRED takes some options, examples as follows:<br><br>POWER WIRED. Will shut down 5 seconds after power fails.<br>POWER WIRED DELAY 30. In minutes, how long the device will continue to operate when power fails.<br>POWER WIRED UPS. Operate as long as battery allows when power fails.<br><br>In all these cases, when power is restored the device will start-up again.<br><br>The power button can:<br><br>- be safely used to power off, then on, a device that is running in POWER WIRED mode while the power connected. This allows operators to power cycle a device for troubleshooting, and the device will continue in POWER WIRED mode because power was present <em>at the moment when the operator restarted the device</em>.<br>- start a device that does not have power connected, even while in POWER WIRED mode. In this case it will detect that it had no power when it started, and operate <em>just once&nbsp;</em>in POWER PORTABLE mode instead. This means that if power is later connected and removed, it will still run until the battery is flat, but once this has happened, it will still start automatically if power is applied again.<br><br><br>To switch between modes, POWER WIRED can be cancelled by setting POWER PORTABLE (the default). Note that the power mode is a persistent setting, which means;<br><br>- once set it will continue even if the command is removed from the configuration, and<br>- if the power mode is changed the device will need to be power cycled once to run and apply the command.<br><br>In the event of extreme battery depletion the battery is completely disconnected to preserve it. POWER WIRED now handles this case too, and the device will also start normally from this condition when power is applied.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Pigtail connector</strong></span></h3><p><br></p><p>The top section of your pole may be fitted with a pigtail cable, allowing data to be read out to a standalone display.</p><p><br></p><p>We use a Switchcraft \"Cord Female\" connector EN3C8FX, the mating connector on the WindBot brain is a Switchcraft \"Inline Male\" EN3L8MX.</p><p><br></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pigtail</strong></td><td><strong>Function</strong></td><td><strong>Notes</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>GND</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>TXD/OUT</td><td>4800 8n1 (NMEA0183)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>12V out</td><td>300mA limit.

The unit will begin to power down.            Troubleshooting     Transmitting version After registering the device and inserting a SIM card, create a LIVE race on ww.yacht-bot.com.   Required equipment:  A laptop, tablet, smartphone to view the live race Sufficient sky view to allow TideBot to get a GPS fix A compass or knowledge of True or Magnetic North direction  Now continue with the tests as described in the next section and either during or at the end of it, check the data YachtBot received and displayed.  Non-transmitting version To convince yourself that the TideBot is producing sensible data, enable a WCT measurement and hold the TideBot with both hands and walk briskly due north. Check the measurement while you walk.  If this fails or doesn’t meet your predictions, check the declination settings in the TideBot configuration file (set to AUTO).

The default GPS rate on the YachtBot Minis is 0.3Hz, 1 point every 3 seconds.  At this rate, a unit running for 12 hours would consume around 1.8 Mb of data. This works out to be around 0.15 Mb an hour. i.e For a 7 hour run, a YachtBot Mini would use about 1.1 Mb of data.     It is possible to run the YachtBot Mini at different rates which would either increase or decrease the total data usage, but for most cases 0.3 Hz is sufficient.        What countries will my device work in?  YachtBot Mini comes in many different versions. See identify your device type for more information on cellular roaming.        Is the YachtBot Mini waterproof?  No. Without any precautions, the YachtBot Mini is only splash-proof. The supplied YachtBot bag should help you keep your YachtBot Mini dry and secured in a convenient place. We are however, not guaranteeing anything related to waterproofness.         Will the YachtBot Mini sink if I drop it in the water?  Yes. We suggest that you fill your YachtBot bag with air and polystyrene to increase the chances of it floating! All experimentation on this is at your own risk.        The blue GPS indicator keeps flashing on my YachtBot Mini. What's wrong?  Your device isn’t getting a GPS fix. This can happen if you’re inside a building or outside surrounded by tall structures or trees. On a boat, make sure the tracker can see the sky.      Contact us at support@igtimi.com if the problem persists.        The green data indicator keeps flashing on my YachtBot Mini. What's wrong?  Check that the SIM card is inserted correctly, with contacts touching the metal and the lock mechanism engaged so that the card is sitting flush.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, make sure that the APN settings are correct.     Contact us at support@igtimi.com if the problem persists.        I can't tell if my YachtBot Mini is on or off!  We agree, it can be tricky to distinguish between a turned off device, and one that’s perfectly connected.     If you don’t have ready access to yacht-bot.com to check the connection status, you can briefly push the power button.     In normal operation:   If none of the two indicators flash, the device is off (or out of battery).  If both lights flash up briefly and turn off together, the device is on and connected.  If only the blue light flashes briefly, the device is off (on older hardware iterations of the 2G version).      When you're dealing with a fault or bad connection, you may see:   If both indicators light up, but the green data connection light keeps flashing, you likely have incorrect APN settings, or the device simply hasn't had enough time to connect to the cellular network.         When I plug my YachtBot Mini into my PC’s USB port, the device shows up then disappears again. What’s wrong?

Setting up the SOS function  To set up your YachtBot Mini as an additional safety device you will need to...      ensure the SIM card inside the YachtBot mini is capable of voice calls, SMS enabled and has appropriate credit.   know the phone number of the SIM card inside your YachtBot mini  turn on your YachtBot mini so it can receive the txt message detailed below.  have a cell phone that can send txt messages.  know the phone number that you want to allocate as the SOS number.     You can then assign up to three mobile phone numbers to receive SOS calls from your YachtBot Mini.    NOTE: Always test that your setup has worked correctly before you head out on the water!     Using a cell phone send the text message detailed below to the phone number of the SIM card inside the YachtBot mini.     To add one SOS number, send the follow SMS (text message) to the YAchtBot mini.  0000,A71,number1,,   (noting the trailing two commas). This number is the first one the device calls when the SOS button is pushed, and it receives a txt message with location data. In reverse, when this number calls the YachtBot Mini, it will send a SMS with location to this number.     Two additional numbers can be added to be called when the first number doesn’t answer after the button is pressed.  To add two numbers, send    0000,A71,number1,number2,   (noting the single trailing comma) and when adding all three numbers, send    0000,A71,number1,number2,number3     When you receive a return SMS ending in “A71,OK”, the setup was done correctly. If you want to delete all saved phone numbers, send 0000,A71     Additional steps 2G version  The A71 command turns on not just the SOS message, but also others, such as low battery, lost GPS fix, etc. If you are dealing with small numbers of YachtBot only, the increased number of txt messages isn't typically a problem. If your fleet is larger, we recommend taking these additional steps to turn off the unwanted messages. The below example references the same phone number you input using A71 above.     0000,B99,number1,DEL,17,19,20,21,34,35,36              ","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2018-11-07T14:49:38+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000060594,"name":"YachtBot Mini","description":"","created_at":"2015-10-23T17:20:18+13:00","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:49:59+13:00","category_id":8000022006,"visibility":1,"position":4,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000060594,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000050036,"position":7,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":0,"thumbs_down":0,"hits":149,"created_at":"2017-03-06T16:00:38+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:38+12:00","folder_id":8000060594,"title":"Changing the battery","description":"<p>Use only supplied YachtBot batteries in YachtBot Mini.

Usually, it will connect straight away - it will automagically find and use any \"data settings\" (APN, username, and password) that may be required by the carrier that provided the SIM.     In some cases though, it may be necessary to enter these data settings manually to make the SIM work.     If you are responsible for preparing devices for use overseas, then it is a good idea to check the data settings are correct in advance to help ensure that any remote support is keep to a minimum.     Finding the data settings  Start by getting the correct settings from the internet at www.unlockit.co.nz/mobilesettings/. Select the provider of your SIM using the two-letter ISO country code and carrier name. For this example, we are going to search for Orange, in France.          Take note of all the \"Data Settings\".          Entering the data settings manually can be done in one of two ways; either by entering the details into config.ini, or adding a new entry to apns-user.xml, which you will find in the _assets folder of the SD card.     The config.ini technique is the fastest way to enter the data settings. But if you travel and change your SIM a lot, then putting the settings into apns-user.xml will save you time in the future updating your config files.     Adding data settings to config.ini  The APN, username, and password can be entered directly into the config.ini file by looking for the \"Cell\" section     ## Cell\n##\n#\n# 'CELL APN SET custom.apn' sets APN to custom.apn\n# 'CELL APN CLEAR' uses no APN\n# 'CELL APN AUTO' attempts automatic setting of APN (default)\n# 'CELL USER WEB'\n# 'CELL PASS WEB'\n#\n#cell apn set internet\n#     Uncomment and edit the #cell apn set internet line as instructed.

Orientation can be  reported as Euler angles or Quaternions and the \"zero\" orientation is when YachtBot's mounting frame of reference (see Mounting options) is flat to the earth and pointing north.  \n The orientation estimation uses an algorithm that includes Kalman filtering techniques. Raw sensor data input is oversampled, and final estimations low pass filtered to  remove unwanted impulse noise and vibration.  \n   \n Mounting options \n   \n YachtBot can be mounted in several different orthogonal orientations which are configured via the   \n IMU AXES [DECK/BOW/STERN/PORT/STARBOARD]  \n  command. The argument describes the surface of the object that the rear surface of YachtBot is to be mounted against. The GPS antenna should always be pointing up, except for DECK mount, where it should be pointing towards the bow. The option only affects the orientation data, not the kinematic data. \n Raw kinematic data \n Linear acceleration and gyro information may be logged. Linear acceleration can be logged with, or without the static gravity vector included. This is not affected by the mounting option and will use the natural axis of the IMU. For details about the natural axis refer to the attached image on mounting options. \n Calibration and accuracy \n The AHRS has been factory calibrated to correct for linear and non-linear errors in the sensors. Each YachtBot passes calibration testing if 4-points static heading errors are  less than 0.5 degrees in a ferritic-free environment.  \n   \n Zero point offset \n First order Euler angle offsets can be set using the   \n IMU PYR \n command, and can account for any fixed offset errors due to remaining zero offsets in the orientation  estimation, or due to mounting alignments. Note that a first order correction is only suitable for small corrections. Where large mounting errors are present, post-processing rotation of the orientation estimation is recommended. Note that the Euler angle orientation estimation outputs with non-orthogonal mounting are still valid,  but the parameters no longer map directly to the physical properties expected of Pitch/Roll/Yaw.  \n   \n   \n Drift and zeroing of the reference frame  \n YachtBot estimates reference vectors that define the orientation of the earth frame. These reference vectors are determined at power-up and continuously corrected. To  \n ensure that the reference vectors are correctly determined, it's important that YachtBot should be powered up while stationary.  \n   \n Magnetic declination  \n Orientation is measured relative to magnetic north. The angle between magnetic north and true north is called magnetic declination. Where yaw/heading needs to be  \n referenced to true north, using NOAA's empirical declination model is recommend.  \n http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/geomag.shtml  \n   \n Live Data  \n Magnetic heading (HDGM) is transmitted live to the YachtBot server directly using the Yaw field from the Euler angle output. To enable HDGM output in YachtBot, Euler  \n angle messages must be enabled and the mounting configuration correctly configured. The maximum rate for HDGM data is defined by the GPS rate, and it is  \n recommended to set the Euler angle message rate at the same rate as, or multiple of, the GPS rate. An example enabling the Euler message for HDGM is:   \n IMU MESSAGE EULER 1 log 1 live \n  which would set the eular rate to that of the IMU. \n   \n Logfile  \n AHRS data is logged to <Stream_ID>.IMU.NMA. The Steam ID is a monotonically increasing number which is incremented each power cycle.  \n An example of the logfile is;   \n $PGSNC,24391,2013-11-28T21:40:57.886Z,DC-DK-AADK,0xa2*71\n$PIIMU,24390,0x1,-6.0,-139.1,-0.2,*00\n$PIIMU,24500,0x1,-5.9,-139.0,-0.2,*04\n$PIIMU,24750,0x1,-6.0,-138.9,-0.1,*02\n$PIIMU,25000,0x1,-6.0,-138.8,0.0,*2C\n$PIIMU,25250,0x1,-5.9,-138.8,0.1,*20  \n    \n The fields are;  \n\n\n $PGSNC\n\nHeader indicating Proprietary GNSS SyNC message\n\n\n\n\n24391 \n\n\nSystem timer in milliseconds  \n\n\n\n\n2013-11-28T21:40:57.886Z \n\n\nISO8601 timestamp  \n\n\n\n\nDC-DK-AADK \n\n\nDevice Serial number  \n\n\n\n\n0xa2 \n\n\nDevice Stream ID, in hex  \n\n\n\n\n*71 \n\n  NMEA compliant CRC  \n\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\n$PIIMU \n\n\nHeader indicating Proprietary Inertial message from an IMU  \n\n\n\n\n24390 \n\n System timer in milliseconds  \n\n\n 0x1\n\nMessage identifier (Euler angles)\n\n\n -6.0\n\nPitch\n\n\n -139.1\n\n Yaw\n\n\n\n -0.2\n\n Roll\n\n\n\n \n Blank field to assist CSV processing\n\n\n\n *00\n\n NMEA compliant CRC\n\n\n\n   \n For detail on the message types, values, field order and sign conventions, see the appendices below. \n   \n Configuration  \n The following is a typical configuration block for the AHRS.

If you still have trouble after going through this list, please contact us and have a zip file of the contents of your SD card ready.  Data settings (APN, Username and Password))  YachtBot will typically find the correct settings to enable data for your SIM card.  However sometimes you may need to manually configure these using these instructions.     Unlocked yet?  Many new pre-pay SIM’s require being unlocked or activated using SMS or a phone call before they will work in data devices.  How? Check the documentation that came with your SIM card for unlock instructions.  You may need to insert the SIM into a mobile phone first, and ensure you can browse to an internet page from the cell phone.     Got credit?  Check there is credit on the SIM. Some carriers will quote available voice calling credit and data credit separately, ensure you are checking available data credit.  How? Ask your carrier.       SIM lock?  Ensure that the SIM lock has been disabled.    How? Check that when the SIM is placed in a smart phone, the phone should not request a PIN when powering up. If it does, the SIM lock can be disabled by using the phone’s SIM toolkit menu .     On a plan?  Ensure that the SIM is not on a hardware-locked plan (typical in some countries when the carrier provides free-of-charge phones with a long term contract).  How? Check that the SIM works in an unlocked smartphone, and can access the internet.     Local Roaming?  YachtBot strongly recommends against using \"budget\" carriers that rely on roaming agreements with other national carriers to extend their coverage.  Choose a carrier with the best coverage in the area you are operating your devices.

Updating an incorrect firmware image to a device risks damaging the device.  Please follow instructions carefully as no warranty can be provided for failed firmware updates.   Important - April 2022 update and beyond    Updates to version 2.2 (published April 2022) or higher MUST NEVER be downgraded to version 2.1 (build 519) or earlier.    Attempts to downgrade devices WILL BRICK THE DEVICE; these will need to be returned for service, and incur charges to recover.    Devices running version 2.1 (build 519 or earlier) will no longer be able to connect for cellular services from 27 May 2022.  After updating to version 2.2, devices must be connected by cellular at least once before data logging will be enabled.

Version 2.2: BT HFP support in YachtBot Bio is no longer available.  Audio files can still be recorded in earlier builds and uploaded through the YachtBot website.      Firmware update process   Download and unzip firmware using the links at the bottom of this document.  Be sure to match the firmware image with the device type being updated.     Remove the water-proof plug from the bottom of the device and plug a micro-USB cable into the Micro-USB socket.  For TideBot users, remove the bottom lid of the pod for access to the USB port.  Plug the other end of the USB cable into a Microsoft Windows or Linux computer (not Apple Mac). Observe the device power light come on.   Within two seconds, give the power button a short press. All lights start flashing and the device will mount as a USB removable drive as follows:  In the mounted drive, delete the file called firmware.bin.  Drag and drop, or copy and paste, the new firmware image onto the removable drive.  The firmware image is the file ending with the extension \".bin\" previously extracted from the firmware zip file.  Wait for the file copy to finish, and then unplug the USB cable.  Observe the device starting up for a few seconds before it turns off.      You're DONE - the new firmware has now been installed!  Now proceed to update the configuration.     Configuration update process  Always reformat the micro-SD card, then re-load the config.ini file and _assets folder after updating firmware.  Failure to do this may result in the device not functioning correctly.  You can learn more about configuration files here.   Plug the device into USB again, this time do not press the power button and wait for the embedded micro-SD card to mount.  Optionally, save any logs, or existing config.ini file to your computer for safekeeping.  Format the micro-SD card as FAT32.  On windows, right-click then select Format...  Copy the _assets folder to the mounted drive from the previously extracted firmware zip file.  Copy the config.ini file to the mounted drive from the previously extracted firmware zip file.  If multiple config files are available, please copy the config that best matches your hardware specification, and rename the file on the micro-SD card as config.ini.         Firmware recovery procedure  Should a firmware update fail for any reason, then YachtBot will lock on with the power light illuminated and be unresponsive to button presses. A new firmware image can be loaded using the following procedure.   Gently press and hold the reset button (small white pin-hole next to the power socket)   While the reset button is pressed, plug in the USB cable from your computer  Immediately release the reset button and then press the power button once.

If you have damaged a bung contact us for a replacement.  \n","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2018-10-16T14:46:29+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000056916,"name":"YachtBot product family fundamentals","description":"The principles in this section apply to YachtBot, YachtBot Bio, TideBot and WindBot.","created_at":"2015-10-21T16:11:32+13:00","updated_at":"2018-10-16T15:08:27+13:00","category_id":8000022006,"visibility":1,"position":2,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000056916,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000014198,"position":3,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":1,"thumbs_down":0,"hits":140,"created_at":"2015-11-04T12:47:24+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:35+12:00","folder_id":8000084800,"title":"Mounting WindBot","description":"<p>WindBot is sensitive to location on your boat.

When not in cell coverage, the TideBot stores the location data and sends it to our servers as soon as the device is in coverage again and also does a sync cycle at power off. \n   \n   \n Happy sailing! \n   \n","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2018-10-16T10:34:49+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000060596,"name":"TideBot","description":"","created_at":"2015-10-23T17:20:45+13:00","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:49:59+13:00","category_id":8000022006,"visibility":1,"position":5,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000060596,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000049029,"position":4,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":1,"thumbs_down":0,"hits":123,"created_at":"2017-02-08T11:46:12+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:38+12:00","folder_id":8000084800,"title":"How does the WindBot calculate True Wind","description":"<p>True wind is the Wind we feel when we are standing still as the wind moves across the land.  This is the wind that is talked about during weather forecasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparent wind, is the wind we feel when we are walking forward on a calm day.   If there is no wind and we walk forward at 5kt, we will feel a wind strength of 5kt on our face.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/8015757173/original/tooyhpbZFlmbDBs7YgLJROd4ZhgRrh23Tg.png?1486507476\" data-fileid=\"8015757173\" style=\"width: 316px; height: 167.294px;\" data-filelink=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/8015757173/original/tooyhpbZFlmbDBs7YgLJROd4ZhgRrh23Tg.png?1486507476\" data-uniquekey=\"1486507054841\"></p><p><br></p><p>As we move around daily, the wind we feel is a combination of the True Wind and the Apparent wind we generate.</p><p>If there is a breeze of 5kt coming across the land, and we walk towards that breeze at 5kt, we would feel a wind strength of 10kt on our face.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable fr-fil\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/8015757168/original/PW-q-J_fSE2ozEUHl-f7RseBl6oh60OfGQ.png?1486507461\" data-filelink=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/8015757168/original/PW-q-J_fSE2ozEUHl-f7RseBl6oh60OfGQ.png?1486507461\" data-fileid=\"8015757168\" data-uniquekey=\"1486507054841\" style=\"width: 526px; height: 195.052px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>The WindBot has three different sensor types to calculate what the True Wind is, even while we are moving around.  The three sensors include a Global Position Sensor (<strong>GPS</strong>), an Inertial Measurement Unit (<strong>IMU</strong>) and a <strong>Wind sensor</strong>.  The WindBot is able to determine the difference between the Apparent wind (the wind we feel while moving) and the True Wind (the wind on the land), by using these three sensors.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>Wind sensor</strong> measures the Apparent wind that the WindBot feels.  This is the same wind that you feel as you walk around.</p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>GPS</strong> allows the WindBot to know how fast it is moving.  In the first example of walking forwards at 5kt, If the Wind sensors reads 5kt, and the GPS reads a speed of 5kt, then the True Wind must be 0kt and the WindBot can calculate this.</p><p><br></p><p>The<strong> IMU</strong>, is like a compass.  The IMU can tell us what direction we are walking.   In the second example when there is a True Wind of 5kt moving across the land.  The compass will tell the WindBot if we are walking at 5kt away from the Wind, and would feel no wind on our face.  Or if we are walking at 5kt towards the Wind and feel 10kt on our face.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The WindBot needs all three sensors to be working together to calculate the True Wind.</span></strong></p><p><br></p>","user_id":8000284882,"status":1,"desc_un_html":" True wind is the Wind we feel when we are standing still as the wind moves across the land.  This is the wind that is talked about during weather forecasts.

Settings -> Device List) \n\nThe Display Box is functional when two devices appear in this list, the IF-NMEA2K2 device and the display itself.\nOnly the display appears in this list.\n The NMEA converter or connection to it is faulty, or the B&G display is not set up correctly to find and work with it. Contact us.\n \n\n\n\n   \n (2) Static testing\n \n   \n For your WindBot to work, it needs to have a GPS fix, calculate heading correctly, and be exposed to some wind. Outside, with sufficient wind or someone’s strong lungs blowing into a vertically supported pole, and a GPS fix (meaning top green indicator solid), cycle through the different pages set up on your display.\n \n   \n \n \n \n\nStep\nPage\nWhat you see & what it tests\nWhat to do if test fails\n\n\n1\nHeading (HDG)\nShows a number if you have a GPS fix \n\nCheck that GPS fix not lost and follow the instructions in the FAQ.\n\n\n2\nLAT and LON \n\nShows numbers if the GPS and compass work \n\nCheck that GPS fix not lost and follow the instructions in the FAQ.\n\n\n3\nTWD and TWS \n\nNumbers here confirm that GPS, IMU and wind sensor work \n\nSwap brain or wind sensor and observe which component the fault follows.\n If no such page is set up, contact us for instructions on how to do this as you need it for using the system during normal operation\n\n\n4\nCOG and SOG\nEvoke a water current measurement failure mode by pressing the button for 'stick in' and wait for only a few seconds, then press twice for stick out.''\n \n You should see “--- and 44.4”, indicating that the measurement failed because it was too short.\n \n\n \n\n\n    \n (3) Dynamic Testing \n   \n To convince yourself that the WindBot is producing sensible data, point the pole north and blow into the forward facing direction, then rotate by 90 degrees and repeat. Assert that there is a relative agreement between your measurements.\n \n   \n If this fails or doesn’t meet your predictions, check the declination settings in the WindBot configuration file (set to AUTO), that a value you expect is shown in the NMEA converter’s data (see FAQ for instructions), and that the Display’s variation (VAR) is set to AUTO or the correct value.\n \n   ","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2018-10-16T11:03:15+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000060595,"name":"WindBot","description":"","created_at":"2015-10-23T17:20:27+13:00","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:49:59+13:00","category_id":8000022006,"visibility":1,"position":6,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000060595,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000014669,"position":8,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":1,"thumbs_down":1,"hits":123,"created_at":"2015-11-05T18:10:18+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:36+12:00","folder_id":8000084800,"title":"How does YachtBot Mini work?","description":"<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>YachtBot Mini uses the local cell phone network to report its GPS location back to YachtBot every 3 seconds (2G version) or every second (3G version) while in cell phone coverage.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When not in coverage, YachtBot Mini does not communicate with our servers.

To get started, first get the list of available servers;   curl -k -H \"Accept:application/json\" https://www.igtimi.com/server_listers/web_sockets      {\"web_socket_servers\":[\"wss://www.igtimi.com/live_api\",\"ws://live.igtimi.com:9081\"]}        Now open a WebSockets connection to one of the available servers.   java -jar tyrus-client-cli-1.3.jar wss://live.igtimi.com/live_api        # Connecting to wss://live.igtimi.com/live...\n# Connected in session 9ba53f8d-e820-415d-9d72-60cf0260b6ab\n# text-message: 1\n# text-message: 1\n# text-message: 1\n# text-message: 1     Send a configuration block;   session 9ba5...b6ab> send {\"access_token\":\"<token>\",\"devices\":[\"GA-DK-AAAD\"]}     Receive a timestamp;   # text-message: 1384906719000        And any live data that is available for the specified devices will be streamed;   # text-message: [{\"GA-DKAAAD\":{\" 1\":{\"t\":[1384906719040],\"1\":[170.503938],\"2\":[-45.8770313333333]},\"2\":{\"t\"[1384906719040],\"1\":[1]},\"3\":{\"t\":[1384906719040],\"1\":[0]}}},{\"GA-DK-AAAD\":{\"9\":{\"t\":[1384906719040],\"1\":[0]}}}]\n# text-message: [{\"GA-DKAAAD\":{\"1\":{\"t\":[1384906722040],\"1\":[170.503938],\"2\":[-45.877031]},\"2\":{\"t\":[1384906722040],\"1\":[1]},\"3\":{\"t\":[1384906722040],\"1\":[0]}}}]\n# text-message: [{\"GA-DK-AAAD\":{\"9\":{\"t\":[1384906722040],\"1\":[0]}}}]\n# text-message: [{\"GA-DKAAAD\":{\"1\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\"1\":[170.503938],\"2\":[-45.877031]},\"2\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\"1\":[1]},\"3\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],AAAD\":{\"1\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\"1\":[170.503938],\"2\":[-45.877031]},\"2\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\"1\":[1]},\"3\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\n\"1\":[0]}}},{\"GA-DK-AAAD\":{\"9\":{\"t\":[1384906725040],\"1\":[0]}}}]\n.\n.\n.     When done, quit;   session 9ba5...b6ab> quit        WebSockets messages  The WebSocket server sends three kinds of messages, and receives two kinds of messages;     Configuration Block (receive)  The configuration block identifies the user, by their OAuth access token, and the serial numbers for which the client wants to receive the live stream. It should be sent to the WebSocket server  only once, and immediately on establishing a connection e.g;      {\n      \"auth_token\":\"1234567890\",\n      \"units\":[\n         \"AA-AA-AAAA\",\n         \"AA-AA-AAAB\",\n         …\n      ]\n   }     Heartbeats (send/receive)  These consist of the single character \"1\" and are sent every 15 seconds from initiation of the WebSocket connection. The client should continuously monitor for heartbeats or data (see below)  and reconnect if neither are received after an interval of 45 seconds.  The WebSocket server also expects to receive heartbeats from the client, and will drop the connection if no heartbeats are received for greater than 5 minutes.     Timestamp (send)  On receiving the configuration block (see below), the WebSocket server will send a single integer which indicates the WebSocket server time as a JS timestamp. The WebSocket servers are  synchronised to UTC and this timestamp can be used to seed the live playback time in the client to this value at the moment it is received.     Data (send)  Is presented in JSON blocks. The format is identical to data returned by the Igtimi ::data API.     Tyrus  To debug your WebSocket connections it is convenient to use a command line tool. cURL does not support WebSockets, but you can use Tyrus instead. To get started, download the Tyrus  client CLI from the maven repository here; http://search.maven.org/     Ensure that you are running Java version 7 (download), and verify correct operation;   java -jar tyrus-client-cli-1.3.jar ws://echo.websocket.org\n# Connecting to ws://echo.websocket.org...\n# Connected in session c174fe20-4e36-41fb-9845-e5e61fad03d1\nsession c174...03d1> ping\n# pong-message\nsession c174...03d1> quit     ","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2022-02-11T12:56:46+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000056907,"name":"Getting Started","description":"","created_at":"2015-10-21T16:02:14+13:00","updated_at":"2015-10-23T14:02:42+13:00","category_id":8000022007,"visibility":1,"position":1,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000056907,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000009480,"position":3,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":1,"thumbs_down":0,"hits":368,"created_at":"2015-10-21T16:06:18+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:34+12:00","folder_id":8000056907,"title":"Live data (WebSockets)","description":"<p>The API provides a RESTful interface to access device data.  Data is available immediately after it is presented by a device, however using a RESTful API requires regular polling the API for data, which is inefficient and subject to latency.</p><p><br></p><p>A better way to access live data is to connect to one of our <a href=\"http://www.websocket.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WebSocket </a>live data servers.  Live data is presented in exactly the same format as any other data request from the Igtimi API.</p><p><br></p><p>Igtimi may provide more than one different WebSocket servers at any time.  Use the SERVER_LISTERS API call to determine which server(s) are available to connect to.

A YachtBot race session is the container that is used to define:   a specified period in time (i.e. the time that the race is running from and to)   a collection of physical tracking devices that will be deployed on the water (i.e. competitor trackers)   and a set of marker objects that define the course layout on the map (i.e. course marks, start/finish lines, course boundaries).       Below is an example race, where we have a number of trackers deployed on boats, a number of course markers, and of course the race start and finish times.          Do I need to set up a race session before I head out on the water?  No, you can set up your race session after you have been out training. As long as you turn on your tracker while you are training, you can access your data once you are done training.  If you wish for spectators to view the racing or training efforts in real-time, then you would need to set up the race session prior to heading out on the water.           Creating a YachtBot race session     Defining a race is easy. Read below, or watch our short video on Creating a race in YachtBot.     To make the process straight forward, we suggest that you have the following prepared in advance:   Race name  Race start and end times  Competitor tracker assignments - Make sure that you have access to all the required devices (either shared or owned devices) See Managing YachtBot devices for more information about managing devices.  GPS coordinates of race marks (if including race marks in the race session)      To begin, make sure that you are logged in to YachtBot, and have navigated to the dashboard. Select the 'Races' tab, and click on 'Define a Race'.          This will bring you to the Race Editor, where we will setup our race session.     Set session name     Enter in a name for your session. This will be the name displayed at the top of the race session, and how you can locate it in the dashboard.        Set session start and end times     Use the UI elements to enter in a start and end time. Note, these are the start and end times of the session, and not the actual racing start time. We prefer to enter start and end times that are about 20 minutes either side of the race start and end times to allow for delayed race starts etc.   The tracking data will only be visible on the map between these two times, so a larger time period is a safe bet.             Add race yachts     To add race Yachts, locate the 'plus' icon to the right of the Yachts heading.  This will bring up a window enabling you to edit the competitors name, boat number, object colour, and physical tracking device assignment.          Do this for each competitor in your fleet.        Adding race marks     Adding race marks is similar to adding Yachts. Locate the 'Race Marks' heading, and click on the 'plus' icon. Enter in the mark GPS coordinates and click save. For more detailed information on setting race marks, see Adding race marks.             Save the race session     Now that you have a race containing a name, start and end times, yachts, and race marks (optional), go ahead and save the race.  You should now be able to see your race in the 'Races' section of the dashboard.         View the race session     To view the race session, simply select the race from the dashboard, and click the blue 'View' button. You will be redirected to the YachtBot Viewer, where you can view your race.   If your race is in the future (i.e. the data has not been captured yet), then you will get a grayed out map until the day of the race. If the race has already occurred (i.e. you have been out on the water with your device on), then you should see your yachts moving around.              Share the race session  There are two ways to share a race with others. By default races are setup as private, i.e. only the race creator account can see the race.     To enable sharing, select the race from the dashboard, and then click on the 'Share' button. This will bring up a dialog box to configure the race sharing settings.               If you wish to share the race with specific people, i.e. a coach for example, then you can enter their name or email into the field next to the blue invite button. Note: the recipient must already be a contact of your YachtBot account.      The more general way to share is make the race public to anyone with the race link. This is great for spectators watching the racing live.  To make the race public, select the 'Public' box, and click save.        Getting a shareable race link  To get a race link, you first need to make sure that the race is made public, otherwise general viewers will not be able to view the race.  With the race made public, select the race from the dashboard, and then click the blue 'View' button. This will load the YachtBot viewer. The URL in your browser is a shareable link that you can distribute to spectators for viewing.        Making changes to the race session  To make changes to the session, select the race from the dashboard, and click 'Edit'. This will take you back to the YachtBot Editor (where we set up the race initially), where you can edit the name, start and end times, etc. Don't forget to save your changes!

Define the race session  This can be done ahead of time, and you can share the live racing link with others / competitors.   Define a race session. From the YachtBot dashboard, click 'Define a race'.    Fill in session details. Once the race editor loads, work down the left hand column providing a race name and the session start and end times. Note: The session start and session end times are not the same as the race start and race end times. The session start and session end times are used to define the window of time that the viewer will show data for. The race start time will be set in the 'Race Management' console in the Viewer. See below. It is best practice to set the session start time earlier than your expected race start time and for the session end time to be greater than the expected race finish time. This generates a buffer that allows for changes in race schedule to not interfere with your race session.     Add competitor boats to your race session. You can drag YachtBot devices from the column on the right, into the column on the left, and place them under the heading 'Yachts'. Alternatively, you can click the '+' icon beside the 'Yachts' heading and manually enter a boat name, and assign a YachtBot device.     Add race marks to your race session. Click the '+' icon beside the 'Race Marks' heading. Give the mark a friendly name and choose an appropriate colour. If the mark is tracked (i.e Has a YachtBot device attached), then select the device under 'Attach a device'. If you know the Latitude and Longitude of the mark, enter this manually. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the race mark on to the map once you have setup the race mark name, colour and type. If your race mark has a specific type, you can select this under 'Choose Race Mark type'.     Setup your lap line To create a lap line, we need to connect two race marks together to form a line. You can use any of the marks created in step 4, or you can create two new marks. With the two marks created and placed on the map, click on the gear icon beside the mark object in the left column. Under 'Choose connected race mark', select the other lap line mark. Click 'Save and close'.     Save and close the Race Editor. Click the 'Save and close' button in the bottom right corner of the editor.        At this stage, until the day of racing, setup is complete. You can share the live racing link on social media to competitors and spectators. The remaining work will be done live during the event.        Operating race timing in YachtBot Viewer  Pre-race setup  The following need to be completed prior to race commencing.   Set the race start time. This is the time that the race timing engine will begin to start calculating lap line crossings. You can set this time up ahead of time if you know when your racing will start, or you can click on the 'Now' button when the racing begins.      Determine your race start type. Before we carry on, we need to determine what type of race start you have, either a rolling start, or a lap line crossing. A rolling start is where the race timing begins when the flag is dropped. The alternative start is a lap line crossing start, where the boats cross over the lap line to start the timing.    Set the race start column. Lap line crossing start In the 'Start' column, under 'Attach to', use the drop down menu to select your lap line marks. These can be identified by the two mark names having an arrow denoting their connection. i.e. '3 -> Timing'. This will make the start time, the time at which each boat crossed over the lap line.   Rolling start Leave the 'Start' column 'Attach to' set to 'None'. We will manually have the operator set the start time when the race flag drops.     Set the number of race laps. As YachtBot is a sailing tool, the column headings are sailing specific - We are working towards making a more generic version for non-sailing events, but for now, think of each 'Leg' as a 'Lap line crossing'. For each lap that you want to calculate, click on the '+' icon in the top right of the Race Management Console window.     Attach the lap line to each of the 'lap' / 'leg' columns. This will allow the timing system to populate the table with the line crossing times as competitors cross the line. For each of the lap columns, use the drop down list under 'Attach to' to select your lap line marks. Again, the connected marks will be denoted by an arrow. i.e. '3 -> Timing'. The same line crossing will be used for each lap column.      Save the 'lap' / 'leg' columns. For each of the columns you have defined, click the 'Save' icon under each column heading. The small square will go blue to indicate the column settings have been saved.       While racing is happening  The following need to occur while racing is happening.   Race start time. Ensure that the race start time is correct. Changes to the race schedule need to be updated on YachtBot too. The race timing engine cannot calculate lap line crossings before the race start time. This is a feature which keeps false line crossing times out of the timing table.     Start the race. If you are using a rolling start, then you must set the start time for the start column. To set the race start time, press the 'double clocks' icon at the top of the start column. This will set all rows in the start column to have the current time. i.e. now. If you miss the start, then you can manually enter the start times into the start column rows.     Save confirmed entries. Each time the page is loaded (for you, or your viewers) the system begins recalculating all entries in the table. It is best practice to save entries once they are confirmed. This will exclude them from needing to be recalculated. Once the race start time has been confirmed, then you should save the entries. You can do this for the entire column by pressing the 'Double Disk' icon at the top of the column, or for single entries by clicking the 'Single Disk' on the appropriate row.      Track lap line crossings. As competitors cross the lap line in real time, confirm their crossing time is correct in YachtBot. If the time is correct, click the 'Single Disk' icon to confirm the result. The cell will outline blue to indicate confirmed results. If the lap crossing time is incorrect, you can manually enter in the correct time, and then click the 'Single Disk' icon to confirm the result. There a number of functions under the '...' icon. These allow you to mark the lap as 'Skipped', where the timing system will continue to calculate subsequent laps, ignoring the missed crossing. The 'recalculate' button will attempt to recalculate the crossing time, however if there is bad data from a device, this will cause no change. In this case, manually enter the correct time.     Race finish When the race finishes, verify that all results are present and correct. All entries should be 'confirmed' and have blue highlighting around them.         Post race adjustments  YachtBot viewer can replay post racing, even after the racing has finished.  If there are entries in your table that need clarification, then you can scrub through the racing and identify any discrepancies. This is particularly useful when a boat may have missed a line crossing.    Pause the viewer with the affected boat on top of the lap line, and press the 'single clock' icon to set the affected cell time to the current viewer time.          Exporting Race results  With all of your racing results confirmed, in the Race Management Console, navigate back to the first column, the 'Global settings' column, using the 'arrow' buttons at the top of the screen. Press the 'Export timing info' button.  A CSV file will be generated for your race session.

The gold standard is to track the buoys live, so that any course changes are reflected without you having to do anything. Without live tracking, you can still add geostationary buoys, and there are several ways to position them in your YachtBot race. \r\n   \r\n Adding Buoys on YachtBot web app \r\n Login to your YachtBot account\r\n and edit the race you want to add markers to. Add a buoy by clicking the \"+\" button beside the \"Buoys\" section. Name the buoy, select the appropriate type (more on this elsewhere), select a colour and save. Note that it can be very convenient to track mark set, pace and rescue boats as buoys as well. The YachtBot web app excludes them from automatic zooming.   \r\n \r\n \r\n Position \r\n Based on live GPS coordinates \r\n Once created, you can attach a device to your buoy in the edit window for the buoy. Alternatively, you can find the correct device in your list of trackers and drag it onto the Buoys section. Conveniently, you can do this before or after the race. \r\n [On a practical note: YachtBot Mini are very suitable for tracking buoys. Always double bag when using on a mark and detach before moving marks: never drag the electronics through water.] \r\n   \r\n Based on fixed GPS coordinates \r\n If you know the latitudinal and longitudinal position of the buoy from, for example, the mark set boat taking a reading when setting it, you can enter the values (in decimal degrees) for each buoy. Click the wheel icon beside the newly created buoy and fill in the \"Longitude\" and \"Latitude\" fields. Save and close the window. \r\n   \r\n Based on mark rounding \r\n For a completed race, it can be convenient to add buoys after the sailing has finished and all mark rounding data is available on YachtBot. The editor now shows you all tracks of all trackers that were in your race.   \r\n \r\n   \r\n \n \r\n  \r\n Use the map to zoom into approximate location of the buoy and use the time slider to select only a very narrow time window (changing the session start and finish times temporarily) \r\n   \r\n \n \r\n  \r\n This allows you to see the paths of the boats only around the buoy you want to place.  \r\n You can position the buoy where you want it to be by dragging the created buoy from the buoy list onto the map. \r\n   \r\n Happy buoy setting! \r\n","seo_data":{"meta_title":"","meta_description":"","meta_keywords":""},"modified_at":"2016-01-20T15:48:20+13:00","modified_by":8000284882,"folder":{"id":8000060427,"name":"Race Management","description":"Info for owners of races.","created_at":"2015-10-23T12:24:52+13:00","updated_at":"2015-10-23T16:43:00+13:00","category_id":8000039785,"visibility":1,"position":2,"is_default":false,"parent_id":8000060427,"language_id":6,"external_id":null,"customer_folders":[]}},{"id":8000018224,"position":6,"art_type":1,"thumbs_up":1,"thumbs_down":1,"hits":246,"created_at":"2015-11-25T14:34:27+13:00","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:56:37+12:00","folder_id":8000060427,"title":"Embedding a race into your website","description":"<p>YachtBot races are easy to view online, and the unique link to a specific race is easily generated and shared.
